** Key Concepts of AWS IAM
http://aws.amazon.com/iam/
| Concepts    | Summary                                             |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Users       | Create individual users.                            |
| Groups      | Manage permissions with groups.                     |
| Permissions | Grant least privilege.                              |
| Auditing    | Turn on AWS CloudTrail.                             |
| Password    | Configure a strong password policy.                 |
| MFA         | Enable MFA for privileged users.                    |
| Roles       | Use IAM roles for EC2 instances.                    |
| Sharing     | Use IAM roles to share access.                      |
| Rotate      | Rotate security credentials regularly.              |
| Conditions  | Restrict privileged access further with conditions. |
| Root        | Reduce/remove use of root.                          |
** When should I use an IAM user, IAM group or IAM role?
http://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/
- An IAM user has permanent long-term credentials and is used to directly interact with AWS services.
- An IAM group is primarily a management convenience to manage the same set of permissions for a set of IAM users.
- An IAM role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity with permissions to make AWS service requests.

  IAM roles cannot make direct requests to AWS services, they are
  meant to be "assumed" by authorized entities, such as IAM users,
  applications or AWS services like EC2. IAM roles are used to
  delegate access within or between AWS accounts.
** [#A] Two different permission models: User-based and Resource-based
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies_permissions.html
- User-based permissions are attached to an IAM user, group, or role
  and let you specify what that user, group, or role can do. For
  example, you can assign permissions to the IAM user named Bob,
  stating that he has permission to use the Amazon Elastic Compute
  Cloud (Amazon EC2) RunInstances action and that he has permission to
  get items from an Amazon DynamoDB table named MyCompany. The user
  Bob might also be granted access to manage his own IAM security
  credentials. User-based permissions can be managed or inline.

- Resource-based permissions are attached to a resource. You can
  specify resource-based permissions for Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon
  Glacier vaults, Amazon SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, and AWS Key
  Management Service encryption keys. Resource-based permissions let
  you specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can
  perform on it. Resource-based policies are inline only, not managed.

** [#B] Security provided by AWS
The AWS cloud infrastructure has been architected to be one of the most flexible and secure cloud computing environments available today. It provides an extremely scalable, highly reliable platform that enables customers to deploy applications and data quickly and securely.
Not only are your applications and data protected by highly secure facilities and infrastructure, but they're also protected by extensive network and security monitoring systems. These systems provide basic but important security measures such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection and password brute-force detection on AWS Accounts. Additional security measures include:

Secure access - Customer access points, also called API endpoints, allow secure HTTP access (HTTPS) so that you can establish secure communication sessions with your AWS services using SSL.
Built-in firewalls - You can control how accessible your instances are by configuring built-in firewall rules - from totally public to completely private, or somewhere in between. And when your instances reside within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnet, you can control egress as well as ingress.
Unique users - The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool allows you to control the level of access your own users have to your AWS infrastructure services. With AWS IAM, each user can have unique security credentials, eliminating the need for shared passwords or keys and allowing the security best practices of role separation and least privilege.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - AWS provides built-in support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for use with AWS Accounts as well as individual IAM user accounts.
Private Subnets - The AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service allows you to add another layer of network security to your instances by creating private subnets and even adding an IPsec VPN tunnel between your home network and your AWS VPC.
Encrypted data storage - Customers can have the data and objects they store in Amazon S3, Glacier, Redshift, and Oracle RDS encrypted automatically using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256, a secure symmetric-key encryption standard using 256-bit encryption keys.
Dedicated connection option - The AWS Direct Connect service allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your premise to AWS. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple logical connections to enable you to access both public and private IP environments within your AWS cloud.
Security logs - AWS CloudTrail provides logs of all user activity within your AWS account. You can see what actions were performed on each of your AWS resources and by whom.
Isolated GovCloud - For customers who require additional measures in order to comply with US ITAR regulations, AWS provides an entirely separate region called AWS GovCloud (US) that provides an environment where customers can run ITAR-compliant applications, and provides special endpoints that utilize only FIPS 140-2 encryption.
CloudHSM - For customers who must use Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances for cryptographic key storage, AWS CloudHSM provides a highly secure and convenient way to store and manage keys.
Trusted Advisor - Provided automatically when you sign up for premium support, the Trusted Advisor service is a convenient way for you to see where you could use a little more security. It monitors AWS resources and alerts you to security configuration gaps such as overly permissive access to certain EC2 instance ports and S3 storage buckets, minimal use of role segregation using IAM, and weak password policies.

AWS Lambda is an event-driven task compute service that runs your code
in response to "events" such as changes in data, website clicks, or
messages from other AWS services without you having to manage any
compute infrastructure.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction-function.html#java-invocation-options
AWS Lambda supports synchronous and asynchronous invocation of a Lambda function.

** HALF When will AWS drop the AWS Lambda container?
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html
It takes time to set up a container and do the necessary
bootstrapping, which adds some latency each time the Lambda function
is invoked. You typically see this latency when a Lambda function is
invoked for the first time or after it has been updated because AWS
Lambda tries to reuse the container for subsequent invocations of the
Lambda function.

After a Lambda function is executed, AWS Lambda maintains the
container for *some time* in anticipation of another Lambda function
invocation.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
So AWS will start a container to run my lambda function. And reuse it, if I call it again in a short period.

I'm interested how long AWS will delete the container on average.
Like 30 seconds, 30 minutes or 2 hours, etc?
#+END_EXAMPLE
** HALF Examples of How to Use AWS Lambda
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/use-cases.html
The use cases for AWS Lambda can be grouped into the following categories:

Using AWS Lambda with AWS services as event sources - Event sources publish events that cause the Lambda function to be invoked. These can be AWS services such as Amazon S3. For more information and tutorials, see the following topics:
Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3
Using AWS Lambda with Kinesis
Using AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB
Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudTrail
Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS from Different Accounts
On-demand Lambda function invocation over HTTPS (Amazon API Gateway) - In addition to invoking Lambda functions using event sources, you can also invoke your Lambda function over HTTPS. You can do this by defining a custom REST API and endpoint using API Gateway. For more information and a tutorial, see Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway (On-Demand Over HTTPS).
On-demand Lambda function invocation (build your own event sources using custom apps) - User applications such as client, mobile, or web applications can publish events and invoke Lambda functions using the AWS SDKs or AWS Mobile SDKs, such as the AWS Mobile SDK for Android. For more information and a tutorial, see Getting Started and Using AWS Lambda as Mobile Application Backend (Custom Event Source: Android)
Scheduled events - You can also set up AWS Lambda to invoke your code on a regular, scheduled basis using the AWS Lambda console. You can specify a fixed rate (number of hours, days, or weeks) or you can specify a cron expression. For more information and a tutorial, see Using AWS Lambda with Scheduled Events.

** DONE Understand Context Object in the function signature
   CLOSED: [2017-10-12 Thu 14:02]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-context-object.html

While a Lambda function is executing, it can interact with the AWS
Lambda service to get useful runtime information such as:

- How much time is remaining before AWS Lambda terminates your Lambda function (timeout is one of the Lambda function configuration properties).
- The CloudWatch log group and log stream associated with the Lambda function that is executing.
- The AWS request ID returned to the client that invoked the Lambda function. You can use the request ID for any follow up inquiry with AWS support.
- If the Lambda function is invoked through AWS Mobile SDK, you can learn more about the mobile application calling the Lambda function.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Copy
from __future__ import print_function

import time
def get_my_log_stream(event, context):
    print("Log stream name:", context.log_stream_name)
    print("Log group name:",  context.log_group_name)
    print("Request ID:",context.aws_request_id)
    print("Mem. limits(MB):", context.memory_limit_in_mb)
    # Code will execute quickly, so we add a 1 second intentional delay so you can see that in time remaining value.

Once again your customers are concerned about the security of their sensitive data and with their latest enquiry ask about what happens to old storage devices on AWS. What would be the best answer to this question?

AWS uses a 3rd party security organisation to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process.
AWS reformats the disks and uses them again.
AWS uses the techniques detailed in DoD 5220.22-M to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process.
AWS uses their own proprietary software to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process.

C

When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, AWS procedures include a decommissioning process that is designed to prevent customer data from being exposed to unauthorized individuals.
AWS uses the techniques detailed in DoD 5220.22-M ("National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual ") or NIST 800-88 ("Guidelines for Media Sanitization") to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process.
All decommissioned magnetic storage devices are degaussed and physically destroyed in accordance with industry-standard practices.

Elastic IP addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic
cloud computing. However, unlike traditional static IP addresses,
Elastic IP addresses enable you to mask instance or Availability Zone
failures by programmatically remapping your public IP addresses to
instances in your account in a particular region. For DR, you can also
pre -allocate some IP addresses for the most critical systems so that
their IP addresses are already known before disaster strikes. This can
simplify the execution of the DR plan.
*** DONE [#A] Why we need EIP, instead of normal public IP?       :IMPORTANT:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html
If you use dynamic DNS to map an existing DNS name to a new instance's
public IP address, it might take up to 24 hours for the IP address to
xopropagate through the Internet. As a result, new instances might not
receive traffic while terminated instances continue to receive
requests. To solve this problem, use an EIP.

Elastic IP Addresses - You can have one Elastic IP (EIP) address associated with a running instance at no charge.
** DONE [#A] Feature: what happen if we stop a running instance
   CLOSED: [2015-04-01 Wed 00:14]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html
When you stop a running instance, the following happens:

The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running; its status changes to stopping and then stopped.

Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached to the instance, and their data persists.

Any data stored in the RAM of the host computer or the instance store volumes of the host computer is gone.

EC2-Classic: We release the public and private IP addresses for the instance when you stop the instance, and assign new ones when you restart it.

EC2-VPC: The instance retains its private IP addresses when stopped and restarted. We release the public IP address and assign a new one when you restart it.

EC2-Classic: We disassociate any Elastic IP address (EIP) that's associated with the instance. You're charged for Elastic IP addresses that aren't associated with an instance. When you restart the instance, you must associate the Elastic IP address with the instance; we don't do this automatically.

EC2-VPC: The instance retains its associated Elastic IP addresses (EIP). You're charged for any Elastic IP addresses associated with a stopped instance.

When you stop and restart a Windows instance, by default, we change the instance host name to match the new IP address and initiate a reboot. By default, we also change the drive letters for any attached Amazon EBS volumes. For more information about these defaults and how you can change them, see Configuring a Windows Instance Using the EC2Config Service in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Microsoft Windows Instances.

If you've registered the instance with a load balancer, it's likely that the load balancer won't be able to route traffic to your instance after you've stopped and restarted it. You must de-register the instance from the load balancer after stopping the instance, and then re-register after starting the instance. For more information, see De-Registering and Registering Amazon EC2 Instances in the Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide.

When you stop a ClassicLink instance, it's unlinked from the VPC to which it was linked. You must link the instance to the VPC again after restarting it. For more information about ClassicLink, see ClassicLink.
** DONE [#A] For Reserved Instances, if I stop it for several hours, will I be still charged?
  CLOSED: [2015-04-06 Mon 16:33]
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/

When you are comparing TCO, we highly recommend that you use the Reserved Instance (RI) pricing option in your
calculations. They will provide the best apples-to-apples TCO comparison between on-premises and cloud infrastructure.
Reserved Instances are similar to on-premises servers because in both cases, there is a one-time upfront cost. However,
unlike on-premises servers, Reserved Instances can be "purchased" and provisioned within minutes-and you have the
flexibility to turn them off when you don't need them and stop paying the hourly rate.

Rserved Instance is a pricing model. If you buy an Reserved Instances,
but no running instances match this model or no instances running,
you're still charged every hour.
** [#A] If you restarted an instance N times within one hour, you will be charged for N full hours.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html

When you stop an instance, we shut it down. We don't charge hourly usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees, but we do charge for the storage for any Amazon EBS volumes. Each time you start a stopped instance we charge a full instance hour, even if you make this transition multiple times within a single hour.

A user has launched an EBS backed instance. The user started the instance at 9 AM in the morning. Between 9 AM to 10 AM, the user is testing some script. Thus, he stopped the instance twice and restarted it. In the same hour the user rebooted the instance once. For how many instance hours will AWS charge the user?

4 hours
3 hours
1 hour
2 hours

B
A user can stop/start or reboot an EC2 instance using the AWS console, the Amazon EC2 CLI or the Amazon EC2 API. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. When the instance is rebooted AWS will not charge the user for the extra hours. In case the user stops the instance, AWS does not charge the running cost but charges only the EBS storage cost. If the user starts and stops the instance multiple times in a single hour, AWS will charge the user for every start and stop. In this case, since the instance was rebooted twice, it will cost the user for 3 instance hours.

A user has launched an EBS backed EC2 instance. What will be the difference while performing the restart or stop/start options on that instance?

For restart it charges extra only once, while for every stop/start it will be charged as a separate hour
For restart it does not charge for an extra hour, while  every stop/start it will be charged as a separate hour
Every restart is charged by AWS as a separate hour, while multiple start/stop actions during a single hour will be counted as a single hour
For every restart or start/stop it will be charged  as a separate hour

B

For an EC2 instance launched with an EBS backed AMI, each time the instance state is changed from stop to start/ running, AWS charges a full instance hour, even if these transitions happen multiple times within a single hour. Anyway, rebooting an instance AWS does not charge a new instance billing hour.

- Spot prices are typically far below (recently 86% lower, on average) On Demand prices

Spot Instances can significantly lower their Amazon EC2 costs for use
cases like batch processing, scientific research, image processing,
video encoding, data and web crawling, financial analysis, and
testing.

- The key differences between Spot Instances and On-Demand instances are that Spot Instances might not start immediately.

- Amazon EC2 adjusts the Spot Price periodically as requests come in and available supply changes.

- To use Spot Instances, you place a Spot Instance request specifying
  the maximum price you are willing to pay per instance hour.

  If your maximum price bid exceeds the current Spot Price, your
  request is fulfilled and your instances will run until either you
  choose to terminate them or the Spot Price increases above your
  maximum price (whichever is sooner).

- If you're running Spot Instances and your maximum price no longer
  meets or exceeds the current Spot Price, your instances will be
  terminated.

How Can Spot Instances Optimize My EC2 Utilization?

Using Spot Instances can generate savings that you can keep, invest
elswhere, or pass on to your customers. Because Spot prices are
typically far below (recently 86% lower, on average) On Demand prices,
you can lower the cost of your interruption-tolerant tasks and,
potentially, accelerate those applications when there are many Spot
Instances available.

There are four general categories of time-flexible and interruption-tolerant tasks that work well with Spot Instances:
Optional tasks. These tasks are nice-to-have but not strictly required. When Spot prices are low, you can run your optional tasks, and when they rise too high you can stop them.
Delayable tasks. These tasks have deadlines that allow you to be flexible about when you run your computations (e.g., weekly batch jobs or media transcoding).
Acceleratable tasks. These tasks can be sped up by adding additional computing power. You can run Spot Instances to accelerate your computing when the Spot price is low while maintaining a baseline layer of On-Demand or Reserved Instances (e.g., using Spot task nodes and On-Demand master and core nodes in an Elastic MapReduce job).
Large scale tasks. These tasks may require computing scale that you can't access any other way. With Spot, you can cost-effectively run thousands or more instances in AWS regions around the world.

- AWS dedicated instances are instances that do not share hardware with other AWS accounts.

- A dedicated per region fee (note that you pay this once per hour
  regardless of how many Dedicated Instances you're running).

https://gigaom.com/2014/04/22/the-use-of-amazons-dedicated-cloud-instances-may-be-on-rise-but-does-that-make-sense/
- But now, 9 months after price cuts, 0.5 percent of the instances it
  monitors are dedicated. (Cloudyn said it has eyes on 8 percent of
  total AWS workloads.)

Real reasons behind such a move:
- Compliance: for one reason or another, an organization may have
  certain restrictions and requirements of where data is placed and
  its accessibility. Having dedicated instances with your own hardware
  provides you peace of mind that no other organization, company or
  deployment will be running alongside

- Performance: while mostly theoretical, having dedicated hardware for
  your use only can avoid other deployment which may utilize or use
  your instances in one way or another, thus reducing
  performance. Some companies wish to avoid such noisy neighbors using
  their pool.

- If recalled, Netflix wished to avoid such neighbors, so they
  upgraded to the largest available instances, which ended up being
  dedicated since no one else could use them.

** DONE [#A] EC2 tags: categorize your AWS resources in a flexible way
  CLOSED: [2015-04-01 Wed 13:20]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-launch.html
- Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.
  You can use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure.

- You can't terminate, stop, or delete a resource based solely on its tags; you must specify the resource identifier.

  For example, to delete snapshots that you tagged with a tag key
  called DeleteMe, you must first get a list of those snapshots using
  DescribeSnapshots with a filter that specifies the tag.


Adding a Name Tag to Your Instance

To add the tag Name=MyInstance to your instance, use the create-tags command as follows:

$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-xxxxxxxx --tags Key=Name,Value=MyInstance
The following is example output:

{
    "return": "true"
}

- M3 instances provide better, more consistent performance that M1 instances for most use-cases.
- M3 instances also offer SSD-based instance storage
- M3 instances are also less expensive than M1 instances.

However, if you need more disk storage than what is provided in M3

applications.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Q: M1 and M3 Standard instances have the same ratio of CPU and memory. When should I use one instance over the other?

M3 instances provide better, more consistent performance that M1
instances for most use-cases.  M3 instances also offer SSD-based
instance storage that delivers higher I/O performance. M3 instances
are also less expensive than M1 instances. Due to these reasons, we
recommend M3 for applications that require general purpose instances
with a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. However, if
you need more disk storage than what is provided in M3 instances, you
may still find M1 instances useful for running your applications.

- Snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume

Q: Do volumes need to be un-mounted in order to take a snapshot? Does the snapshot need to complete before the volume can be used again?

No, snapshots can be done in real time while the volume is attached and in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or OS. In order to ensure consistent snapshots on volumes attached to an instance, we recommend cleanly detaching the volume, issuing the snapshot command, and then reattaching the volume. For Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, we recommend shutting down the machine to take a clean snapshot.

Q. How do Dense-storage instances compare to High I/O instances?

High I/O instances (I2) are targeted at workloads that demand low latency and high random I/O in addition to moderate storage density and provide the best price/IOPS across other EC2 instance types. Dense-storage instances (D2) are optimized for applications that require high sequential read/write access and low cost storage for very large data sets and provide the best price/GB-storage and price/disk-throughput across other EC2 instances.

The TRIM command allows the operating system to inform SSDs which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.

The TRIM command allows the operating system to inform SSDs which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally. In the absence of TRIM, future write operations to the involved blocks can slow down significantly. Currently HI1.4xlarge instances do not support TRIM, but TRIM support will be deployed within the next few months. Customers with extremely intensive full LBA random write workloads should plan accordingly. Please note that the current disk provisioning scheme for High I/O instances minimizes the impact of write amplification and most customers will not experience any issues.

   CLOSED: [2015-04-29 Wed 22:52]
http://searchaws.techtarget.com/tip/Dissecting-AWS-EC2-Reserved-Instances-for-savings
The previous AWS RI pricing model left something to be desired. The
massive upfront costs drove users away. Even if customers liked the RI
framework, its CAPEX-heavy purchasing model outweighed why many turned
to AWS in the first place -- OPEX optimization.

Previous AWS RI pricing levels were based on usage patterns: Light,
Medium and Heavy Utilization. Light Utilization RIs were geared toward
two- to five-month periods of AWS use; Medium RIs worked for five- to
10-month usage timeframes; Heavy RIs were created for continuous
usage. This concept gave AWS customers the ability to save 20% to 60%,
but came with a challenge. To see the cost savings, IT teams needed to
properly match user experience with buying behavior. And if they
didn't, they paid more. For example, if a user purchased a Light
Utilization RI and ran it for 11 months -- longer than its recommended
usage -- it would become more expensive than a Medium or Heavy
Utilization RI.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In general, yes.  Every time you start an instance you are immediately charged for one hour of running.  Every time your instance goes over a 60 minute boundary (from when it started) you are also charged for one hour of running.

The hours are based on the time you started the instance, not time of day on a wall clock.  An instance that runs from 2:45 to 3:15 is charged for a single hour of running.

If you stop an instance and then start the same instance again, you are charged for another hour upon starting it, even if you are still within the same 60 minute period as when it was stopped.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html
- If the instance that the volume is attached to is running, you must
  unmount the volume (from the instance) before you detach it.

- If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, you must stop
  the instance before you can detach the volume.
*** Force Detach
 Forcing the detachment can lead to data loss or a corrupted file
 system. Use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from
 a failed instance, or if you are detaching a volume with the
 intention of deleting it. The instance doesn't get an opportunity to
 flush file system caches or file system metadata. If you use this
 option, you must perform file system check and repair procedures.

If you've tried to force the volume to detach multiple times over several minutes and it stays in the detaching state, you can post a request for help to the Amazon EC2 forum.
*** Question
An EBS volume was unable to detach from an instance. Thus, the user used the Force Detach option. Which of the below mentioned options can happen after the volume has been Forcibly detached?

AWS deletes the volume automatically since it will be in a corrupted state
The instance may not be able to flush the file system and may result in a corrupted file system of the volume
The volume will be available but cannot be attached to any instance in the future
AWS terminates the instance automatically since the file system is corrupted

B

If the EBS volume stays in the detaching state, the user can force the detachment by clicking Force Detach. Forcing the detachment can lead to either data loss or a corrupted file system. The user should use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance or if he is detaching a volume with the intention of deleting it. The instance does not get an opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If the user uses this option, he must perform a file system check and repair the procedures.

** DONE [#C] M1 and M3 instance difference: the same ratio of CPU and memory, but M3 is better in most cases
  CLOSED: [2015-05-05 Tue 10:06]
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/
Q: M1 and M3 Standard instances have the same ratio of CPU and memory. When should I use one instance over the other?

M3 instances provide better, more consistent performance that M1 instances for most use-cases.  M3 instances also offer SSD-based instance storage that delivers higher I/O performance. M3 instances are also less expensive than M1 instances. Due to these reasons, we recommend M3 for applications that require general purpose instances with a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. However, if you need more disk storage than what is provided in M3 instances, you may still find M1 instances useful for running your applications.
#  --8<-------------------------- separator ------------------------>8--


You have been using T2 instances as your CPU requirements have not been that intensive. However you now start to think about larger instance types and start lookig at M1 and M3 instances. You are a little confused as to the differences between them as they both seem to have the same ratio of CPU and memory. Which statement below is incorrect as to why you would use one over the other?

M3 instances are less expensive than M1 instances.
M3 instances provide better, more consistent performance that M1 instances for most use-cases.
M3 instances also offer SSD-based instance storage that delivers higher I/O performance.
M3 instances are configured with more swap memory than M1 instances.

D

Amazon EC2 allows you to set up and configure everything about your instances from your operating system up to your applications. An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is simply a packaged-up environment that includes all the necessary bits to set up and boot your instance.
M1 and M3 Standard instances have the same ratio of CPU and memory, some reasons below as to why you would use one over the other.
M3 instances provide better, more consistent performance that M1 instances for most use-cases.

** DONE [#B] Feature: Amazon Machine Images use one of two types of virtualization: HVM and PV
  CLOSED: [2015-05-08 Fri 14:27]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html

HVM is wining over PV now.
| Virtualization Type            | Summary |
|--------------------------------+---------|
| paravirtual (PV)               |         |
| hardware virtual machine (HVM) |         |

The main difference between PV and HVM AMIs is the way in which they
boot and whether they can take advantage of special hardware
extensions (CPU, network, and storage) for better performance.

- Paravirtual guests can run on host hardware that does not have
  explicit support for virtualization, but they cannot take advantage
  of special hardware extensions such as enhanced networking or GPU
  processing.

- Unlike PV guests, HVM guests can take advantage of hardware
  extensions that provide fast access to the underlying hardware on
  the host system.

- All current generation instance types support HVM AMIs.

- For the best performance, we recommend that you use current
  generation instance types and HVM AMIs when you launch new
  instances.

- Historically, PV guests had better performance than HVM guests in
  many cases, but because of enhancements in HVM virtualization and
  the availability of PV drivers for HVM AMIs, this is no longer true.

- Paravirtual guests traditionally performed better with storage and
  network operations than HVM guests because they could leverage
  special drivers for I/O that avoided the overhead of emulating
  network and disk hardware, whereas HVM guests had to translate these
  instructions to emulated hardware.

- Description: A text string that describes the template.
- Mappings: A mapping of keys and associated values that you can use to specify conditional parameter values. This is CloudFormation's version of a "case" statement.
- Outputs: Describes the values that are returned whenever you view your stack's properties. This gets displayed in the AWS CloudFormation Console.
- Parameters: Specifies values that you can pass in to your template at runtime.
- Resources: Specifies the stack resources and their properties, like our EC2 instance. This is the only required property.

- A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit.
  If delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted.

- You are charged for the stack resources for the time they were
  operating (even if you deleted the stack right away).

- There is no additional charge for AWS CloudFormation itself.

You can use AWS CloudFormation to automatically install, configure,
and start applications on Amazon EC2 instances. Doing so enables you
to easily duplicate deployments and update existing installations
without connecting directly to the instance, which can save you a lot
of time and effort.

AWS CloudFormation includes a set of helper scripts (cfn-init,
cfn-signal, cfn-get-metadata, and cfn-hup) that are based on
cloud-init. You call these helper scripts from your AWS CloudFormation
templates to install, configure, and update applications on Amazon EC2
instances that are in the same template.

  "Description" : "AWS CloudFormation Sample Template AutoScalingMultiAZWithNotifications: Create a multi-az, load balanced and Auto Scaled sample web site running on an Apache Web Serever. The application is configured to span all Availability Zones in the region and is Auto-Scaled based on the CPU utilization of the web servers. Notifications will be sent to the operator email address on scaling events. The instances are load balanced with a simple health check against the default web page. **WARNING** This template creates one or more Amazon EC2 instances and an Elastic Load Balancer. You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.",

AWS CloudFormation provides a set of Python helper scripts that you
can use to install software and start services on an Amazon EC2
instance

AWS CloudFormation provides the following helpers
| Helper           | Summary                                                                                                                                                                      |

| cfn-init         | Used to retrieve and interpret the resource metadata, installing packages, creating files and starting services.                                                             |
| cfn-signal       | A simple wrapper to signal an AWS CloudFormation CreationPolicy or WaitCondition, enabling you to synchronize other resources in the stack with the application being ready. |
| cfn-get-metadata | A wrapper script making it easy to retrieve either all metadata defined for a resource or path to a specific key or subtree of the resource metadata.                        |
| cfn-hup          | A daemon to check for updates to metadata and execute custom hooks when the changes are detected.                                                                            |
*** question
A user is planning to use AWS Cloudformation. Which of the below mentioned functionalities does not help him to correctly understand Cloudformation?

Cloudformation works with a wide variety of AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, VPC, IAM, S3, RDS, ELB, etc
AWS Cloudfromation does not charge the user for its service but only charges for the AWS resources created with it
CloudFormation provides a set of application bootstrapping scripts which enables the user to install software
Cloudformation follows the DevOps model for the creation of Dev & Test

D

AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling, deployment, configuration, management and related activities. It supports a wide variety of AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, AS, ELB, RDS, VPC, etc. It also provides application bootstrapping scripts which enable the user to install software packages or create folders. It is free of the cost and only charges the user for the services created with it. The only challenge is that it does not follow any model, such as DevOps; instead customers can define templates and use them to provision and manage the AWS resources in an orderly way.

** DONE CloudFormation required steps question
  CLOSED: [2015-05-05 Tue 11:37]
A customer is using AWS for Dev and Test. The customer wants to setup the Dev environment with Cloudformation. Which of the below mentioned steps are not required while using Cloudformation?

Create a stack
Create and upload the template
Configure a service
Provide the parameters configured as part of the template

C

AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling, deployment, configuration, management and related activities. AWS CloudFormation introduces two concepts: the template and the stack. The template is a JSON-format, text-based file that describes all the AWS resources required to deploy and run an application. The stack is a collection of AWS resources which are created and managed as a single unit when AWS CloudFormation instantiates a template. While creating a stack, the user uploads the template and provides the data for the parameters if required.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
You have been handed a major project with one of the caveats being that you need to use Cloudformation and also include the following services: Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, Amazon Kinesis ,Amazon Glacier and Amazon ElastiCache. You find out however that one of these services is not supported by Cloudformation. Which one?

Amazon Glacier
Auto Scaling
Amazon ElastiCache
Amazon RDS

** TODO [#A] What's the mandatory elements for CloudFormation definition
** TODO [#A] CloudFormation procedure to limit downtime question
You work for a startup that has developed a new photo-sharing application for mobile devices. Over recent months your application has increased in popularity; this has resulted in a decrease in the performance of the application due to the increased load.
Your application has a two-tier architecture that is composed of an Auto Scaling PHP application tier and a MySQL RDS instance initially deployed with AWS CloudFormation. Your Auto Scaling group has a min value of 4 and a max value of 8. The desired capacity is now at 8 due to the high CPU utilization of the instances.
After some analysis, you are confident that the performance issues stem from a constraint in CPU capacity, while memory utilization remains low. You therefore decide to move from the general-purpose M3 instances to the compute-optimized C3 instances.
How would you deploy this change while minimizing any interruption to your end users?
A) Sign into the AWS Management Console, copy the old launch configuration, and create a new launch configuration that specifies the C3 instances. Update the Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration. Auto Scaling will then update the instance type of all running instances
B) Sign into the AWS Management Console and update the existing launch configuration with the new C3 instance type. Add an UpdatePolicy attribute to your Auto Scaling group that specifies an AutoScaling RollingUpdate.
C) Update the launch configuration specified in the AWS CloudFormation template with the new C3 instance type. Run a stack update with the new template. Auto Scaling will then update the instances with the new instance type.
D) Update the launch configuration specified in the AWS CloudFormation template with the new C3 instance type. Also add an UpdatePolicy attribute to your Auto Scaling group that specifies an AutoScalingRollingUpdate. Run a stack update with the new template.

A
** TODO [#B] CloudFormation definition question
You have a complex system involving networking, IAM policies, and multiple, three-tier applications. You are still receiving requirements for the new system, so you don't yet know how many AWS components will be present in the final design.
You would like to start defining these AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation so that you can automate and version-control your infrastructure.
How would you use AWS CloudFormation to provide agile new environments for your customers in a cost-effective, reliable manner?
A) Create one single template by hand to encompass all resources that you need for the system, so you only have a single template to version-control.
B) Create multiple separate templates for each logical part of the system, create nested stacks in AWS CloudFormation and maintain several templates to version-control.
C) Create multiple separate templates for each logical part of the system, and provide the outputs from one to the next using an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Instance running the SDK for finer granularity of control.
D) Manually construct the networking layer using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) because this does not change often and then define all other ephemeral resources using AWS CloudFormation.

- Amazon S3 is based on an "eventual consistent" model
- The number of object you can store is unlimited
- By default, your Amazon S3 buckets and objects are private.
- The bucket name you choose must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3.
- After you create a bucket, you cannot change its name.
- Bucket ownership is not transferable.
** TODO [#A] Four mechanisms to controll S3 resource access       :IMPORTANT:
Customers may use four mechanisms for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources:
| Name                        | Summary |
|-----------------------------+---------|
| IAM Policies                |         |
| bucket policies             |         |
| Access Control Lists (ACLs) |         |
| query string authentication |         |

- Amazon S3 offers access policy options broadly categorized as
  **resource-based policies** and **user policies**.

http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/

IAM enables organizations with multiple employees to create and manage
multiple users under a single AWS account. With IAM policies,
companies can grant IAM users fine-grained control to their Amazon S3
bucket or objects while also retaining full control over everything
the users do.

With bucket policies, companies can define rules which apply broadly
across all requests to their Amazon S3 resources, such as granting
write privileges to a subset of Amazon S3 resources. Customers can
also restrict access based on an aspect of the request, such as HTTP
referrer and IP address.

With ACLs, customers can grant specific permissions (i.e. READ, WRITE,
FULL_CONTROL) to specific users for an individual bucket or object.

With query string authentication, customers can create a URL to an
Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time.

By default, all Amazon S3 resources-buckets, objects, and related
subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website
configuration)-are private: only the resource owner, an AWS account
that created it, can access the resource.

*** DONE S3 bucket ACL question
  CLOSED: [2015-05-09 Sat 12:12]
You are signed in as root user on your account but there is an Amazon S3 bucket under your account that you cannot access. What is a possible reason for this?

The S3 bucket is full.
The S3 bucket has reached the maximum number of objects allowed.
You are in the wrong availability zone
An IAM user assigned a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket and didn't specify the root user as a principal

D
With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.
In some cases, you might have an IAM user with full access to IAM and Amazon S3. If the IAM user assigns a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket and doesn't specify the root user as a principal, the root user is denied access to that bucket. However, as the root user, you can still access the bucket by modifying the bucket policy to allow root user access.

** TODO [#A] S3 server side encryption question
A client of yours has a huge amount of data stored on Amazon S3 but is concerned of someone stealing it while it is in transit. You know that all data is encrypted in transit on AWS but which of the following is wrong when describing server-side encryption on AWS?

Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key.
Amazon S3 server-side encryption employs strong multi-factor encryption.
In server-side encryption, you manage encryption/decryption of your data, the encryption keys, and related tools.
Server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest-that is, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks.

C

Amazon S3  encrypts your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you download the objects. You have two options depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys: Server-side encryption and client-side encryption.
Server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest-that is, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. As long as you authenticate your request and you have access permissions, there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted objects. Amazon S3 manages encryption and decryption for you. For example, if you share your objects using a pre-signed URL, that URL works the same way for both encrypted and unencrypted objects.
In client-side encryption, you manage encryption/decryption of your data, the encryption keys, and related tools. Server-side encryption is an alternative to client-side encryption in which Amazon S3 manages the encryption of your data freeing you from the tasks of managing encryption and encryption keys.
Amazon S3 server-side encryption employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.

*** question: eventually consistency for existing objects
A user is updating an object in the Singapore region. The original content has the value "colour=red". The user updates the object with the content as "colour=white". If the user tries to read the value of the object 1 minute after it was uploaded, what will S3 return?

It will return an error saying that the object was not found
It may return either "colour=red" or "colour=white" i.e. any of the value
It will return "colour=white"
It will return "colour=red"
B
The AWS S3 Singapore region supports read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in the Amazon S3 bucket and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES. In this case since it is overwrites, it may return the old or the new object.
*** question: read-after-write for new objects

A user is creating an object in the EU region. The content of the object is the value "colour=red". If the user tries to read the value of the object 1 minute after it was uploaded, what will S3 return?

It will return "colour=red"
It will return  error 404 object not found
It will return an invalid key
It may return an error or  return the value "colour=red"

A
The AWS S3 EU region supports read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in the Amazon S3 bucket and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES. In this case since it is a new request, the object will be available for the user to view.

- Amazon S3 does not currently support object locking.
- If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest time stamp wins
  If this is an issue, you will need to build an object-locking mechanism into your application.

- Updates are key-based; there is no way to make atomic updates across
  keys. For example, you cannot make the update of one key dependent
  on the update of another key unless you design this functionality
  into your application.

http://shlomoswidler.com/2009/12/read-after-write-consistency-in-amazon.html

Read-after-write consistency tightens things up a bit, guaranteeing
immediate visibility of new data to all clients. With read-after-write
consistency, a newly created object or file or table row will
immediately be visible, without any delays.

Note that read-after-write is not complete consistency: there's also read-after-update and read-after-delete.

Many objects that you store in an Amazon S3 bucket might have a well-defined lifecycle, for example:

- If you are uploading periodic logs to your bucket, your application
might need these logs for a week or a month after creation, and after
that you might want to delete them.

- Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of
  time. After that, you might not need real-time access to these
  objects, but your organization might require you to archive them for
  a longer period and then optionally delete them later. Some types of
  data that you might upload to Amazon S3 primarily for archival
  purposes include digital media archives, financial and healthcare
  records, raw genomics sequence data, long-term database backups, and
  data that must be retained for regulatory compliance.

You can add lifecycle configuration to nonversioned buckets and versioning-enabled buckets.

- The Transition and Expiration lifecycle actions enable you to manage
  the lifecycle of current versions of your objects.

- The NonCurrentVersionTransition and NonCurrentVersionExpiration
  actions enable you to manage the lifecycle of noncurrent (previous)
  versions of your objects.

You cannot access the archived objects through the Amazon Glacier console or the API.

[[file:/Users/mac/Dropbox/private_data/emacs_stuff/images/AccessControlAuthorizationFlowBucketResource.png]]

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-s3-evaluates-access-control.html
When Amazon S3 receives a request-for example, a bucket or an object
operation-it first verifies that the requester has the necessary
permissions. Amazon S3 evaluates all the relevant access policies,
user policies, and resource-based policies (bucket policy, bucket ACL,
object ACL) in deciding whether to authorize the request.

e.g

- If the requester is an IAM user
  Amazon S3 must determine if the parent AWS account to which the user
  belongs has granted the user necessary permission to perform the
  operation. In addition, if the request is for a bucket operation,
  such as a request to list the bucket content, Amazon S3 must verify
  that the bucket owner has granted permission for the requester to
  perform the operation.

  To perform a specific operation on a resource, an IAM user needs
  permission from both the parent AWS account to which it belongs and
  the AWS account that owns the resource.

- If the request is for an operation on an object that the bucket owner does not own

In order to determine whether the requester has permission to perform
the specific operation, Amazon S3 does the following, in order, when
it receives a request:

1. Converts all the relevant access policies (user policy, bucket
   policy, ACLs) at run time into a set of policies for evaluation.

2. Evaluates the resulting set of policies in the following steps. In
   each step, Amazon S3 evaluates a subset of policies in a specific
   context, based on the context authority.

    User context, Bucket context and Object context

Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:

With a single PUT operation you can upload objects up to 5 GB in size.
Using the Multipart upload API you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.

- Improved throughput-You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput.
- Quick recovery from any network issues-Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.
- Pause and resume object uploads-You can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expiry; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.
- Begin an upload before you know the final object size-You can upload an object as you are creating it.

A startup company hired you to help them build a mobile application, that will ultimately store billions of images and videos in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The company is lean on funding, and wants to minimize operational costs, however, they have an aggressive marketing plan, and expect to double their current installation base every six months. Due to the nature of their business, they are expecting sudden and large increases in traffic to and from S3, and need to ensure that it can handle the performance needs of their application.   What other information must you gather from this customer in order to determine whether S3 is the right option?

A.		You must know how many customers the company has today, because this is critical in understanding what their customer base will be in two years.
B.		You must find out the total number of requests per second at peak usage.
C.		You must know the size of the individual objects being written to S3, in order to properly design the key namespace.
D.		In order to build the key namespace correctly, you must understand the total amount of storage needs for each S3 bucket.

Amazon S3 provides a set of operations to work with the Amazon S3 resources. Managing S3 resource access refers to granting others permissions to work with S3. There are three ways the root account owner can define access with S3:
S3 ACL: The user can use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts.
S3 Bucket Policy: The policy is used to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users permissions for the bucket and the objects in it.
User Access Policy: Define an IAM user and assign him the IAM policy which grants him access to S3.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-overview.html
** TODO [#A] Is there any object policy in S3?
** S3 ACL and difference
- Generally if user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not inherit it and vice a versa?
- Policy defined in bucket level applied to objects?
- We can't define Object policy in the page of object?
** TODO S3 bucket ACL
A root account owner has created an S3 bucket testmycloud. The account owner wants to allow everyone to upload the objects as well as enforce that the person who uploaded the object should manage the permission of those objects.  Which is the easiest way to achieve this?

The root account owner should create the bucket policy which allows the other account owners to set the object policy of that bucket
The root account owner should create a bucket policy which allows the IAM users to upload the object
The root account should create the IAM users and provide them the permission to upload content to the bucket
The root account should use ACL with the bucket to allow everyone to upload the object

D

Each AWS S3 bucket and object has an ACL (Access Control List) associated with it. An ACL is a list of grants identifying the grantee and the permission granted. The user can use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. ACLs use an Amazon S3-specific XML schema. The user cannot grant permissions to other users in his account. ACLs are suitable for specific scenarios. For example, if a bucket owner allows other AWS accounts to upload objects, permissions to these objects can only be managed using the object ACL by the AWS account that owns the object.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html
** TODO S3 bucket policy to manage ACL at data level, instead of whole bucket
Amazon S3 allows you to set per-file permissions to grant read and/or write access. However you have decided that you want an entire bucket with 100 files already in it to be accessible to the public. You don't want to go through 100 files individually and set permissions. What would be the best way to do this?

Move the files to a new bucket.
Move the bucket to a new region
Use Amazon EBS instead of S3
Add a bucket policy to the bucket.

D
Amazon S3 supports several mechanisms that give you flexibility to control who can access your data as well as how, when, and where they can access it. Amazon S3 provides four different access control mechanisms: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), bucket policies, and query string authentication. IAM enables organizations to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account. With IAM policies, you can grant IAM users fine-grained control to your Amazon S3 bucket or objects. You can use ACLs to selectively add (grant) certain permissions on individual objects.
Amazon S3 bucket policies can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a single bucket.
With Query string authentication, you have the ability to share Amazon S3 objects through URLs that are valid for a specified period of time

http://aws.amazon.com/s3/details/#security
** TODO [#A] S3 folders can have only ACL and cannot have a policy.
A system admin is managing buckets, objects and folders with AWS S3. Which of the below mentioned statements is true and should be taken in consideration by the sysadmin?

Both the object and bucket can have ACL but folders cannot have ACL
The folders support only ACL
Folders can have a policy
Both the object and bucket can have an Access Policy but folder cannot have policy

B
A sysadmin can grant permission to the S3 objects or the buckets to any user or make objects public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy language. Generally if user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket. It cannot be applied at the object level. The folders are similar to objects with no content. Thus, folders can have only ACL and cannot have a policy.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-policy-language-overview.html

The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket.

It cannot be applied at the object level.

** TODO [#A] RDS failover for multi AZ: how fast DNS take effect?
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html
- Failover times are typically 60-120 seconds. However, large
  transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover
  time. When the failover is complete, it can take additional time for
  the RDS console UI to reflect the new Availability Zone.

Due to how the Java DNS caching mechanism works, you may need to reconfigure your JVM environment.
** TODO [#A] Difference between RDS backup and snapshot
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5249842/how-does-amazon-rds-backup-snapshot-actually-work

- Amazon RDS is using EBS as the backing store for its RDS databases.

- Typically, a MySQL backup, in contrast to a snapshot, involves using
  a tool like mysqldump to create a file of SQL statements that will
  then reproduce the database. The database does not need to be frozen
  to do this. With an EBS backend, the best practice is to freeze the
  database (pause all transactions) while you are snapshotting to
  avoid data corruption.
** TODO [#A] When RDS take snapshot, how long the downtime would be?
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshot.html
- Creating this backup on a Single-AZ DB instance results in a brief
  I/O suspension that typically lasting no more than a few minutes.

- Multi-AZ DB instances are not affected by this I/O suspension since
  the backup is taken on the standby.
** TODO [#A] Why change backup retention period, will result in DB reboot?
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Troubleshooting.html#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Security
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html

An outage will occur if you change the backup retention period from 0
to a non-zero value or from a non-zero value to 0.

A DB instance reboot occurs immediately when one of the following occurs:
- You change the backup retention period for a DB instance from 0 to a nonzero value or from a nonzero value to 0 and set Apply Immediately to true.
- You change the DB instance class, and Apply Immediately is set to true.
- You change storage type from standard to PIOPS, and Apply Immediately is set to true.
** TODO [#B] RDS: With Multi AZ feature, the user can not have option to take snapshot from replica.
A user is using a small MySQL RDS DB. The user is experiencing high latency due to the Multi AZ feature. Which of the below mentioned options may not help the user in this situation?

Use a large or higher size instance
Schedule the automated back up in non-working hours
Take a snapshot from standby Replica
Use PIOPS

C
An RDS DB instance which has enabled Multi AZ deployments may experience increased write and commit latency compared to a Single AZ deployment, due to synchronous data replication. The user may also face changes in latency if deployment fails over to the standby replica. For production workloads, AWS recommends the user to use provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) as they are optimized for provisioned IOPS to give a fast, and consistent performance. With Multi AZ feature, the user can not have option to take snapshot from replica.

- DB security group controls access to a DB instance that is not in a VPC
- VPC security group controls access to a DB instance inside a VPC
- Amazon EC2 security group controls access to an EC2 instance and can be used with a DB instance
*** question
You have just built an Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS) and you now need to set up a high level of security for this database as it is very confidential information so you need to find out all the possible options that are available for security. What security groups does Amazon RDS use?

VPC security groups only
DB security groups, and EC2 security groups only
VPC security groups, and EC2 security groups only
DB security groups, VPC security groups, and EC2 security groups

D
A security group controls the access to a DB instance. It does so by allowing access to IP address ranges or Amazon EC2 instances that you specify.
Amazon RDS uses DB security groups, VPC security groups, and EC2 security groups. In simple terms, a DB security group controls access to a DB instance that is not in a VPC, a VPC security group controls access to a DB instance inside a VPC, and an Amazon EC2 security group controls access to an EC2 instance and can be used with a DB instance.

- When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically
  creates a primary DB Instance and **synchronously** replicates the data
  to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ).

- In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware
  failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS
  performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can
  resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

- In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance
  scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to
  the automatic failover.

- DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments may have increased write and
  commit latency compared to a Single-AZ deployment, due to the
  synchronous data replication that occurs.

- Multi-AZ deployments for Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL DB instances
  use Amazon technology, while SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server

You are running PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS and it seems to be all running smoothly deployed in one availability zone.  A database administrator asks you if DB instances running PostgreSQL support Multi-AZ deployments. What would be a correct response to this question?

Yes but only for small db instances.
Yes but you need to request the service from AWS.
Yes.
No.

C

Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several versions of PostgreSQL. Currently we support PostgreSQL versions 9.3.1, 9.3.2, and 9.3.3. You can create DB instances and DB snapshots, point-in-time restores and backups.
DB instances running PostgreSQL support Multi-AZ deployments, Provisioned IOPS, and can be created inside a VPC. You can also use SSL to connect to a DB instance running PostgreSQL.
You can use any standard SQL client application to run commands for the instance from your client computer. Such applications include pgAdmin, a popular Open Source administration and development tool for PostgreSQL, or psql, a command line utility that is part of a PostgreSQL installation. In order to deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS does not provide host access to DB instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges. Amazon RDS supports access to databases on a DB instance using any standard SQL client application. Amazon RDS does not allow direct host access to a DB instance via Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH).

A user has enabled the Multi AZ feature with the MS SQL RDS database server. Which of the below mentioned statements will help the user understand the Multi AZ feature better?

In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data synchronously to the replica copy
In a Multi AZ, AWS runs just one DB but copies the data synchronously to the standby replica
AWS MS SQL does not support the Multi AZ feature
In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data asynchronously to the replica copy

B
Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups. Running a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption.
Note that the high-availability feature is not a scaling solution for read-only scenarios; you cannot use a standby replica to serve read traffic. To service read-only traffic, you should use a read replica.

   CLOSED: [2015-05-03 Sun 18:06]
A user is accessing RDS from an application. The user has enabled the Multi AZ feature with the MS SQL RDS DB. During a planned outage how will AWS ensure that a switch from DB to a standby replica will not affect access to the application?

RDS will have both the DBs running independently and the user has to manually switch over
RDS uses DNS to switch over to  stand by replica for seamless transition
The switch over changes Hardware so RDS does not need to worry about access
RDS will have an  internal IP which will redirect all requests to the new DB
B

In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of a DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if the user has enabled Multi AZ. The automatic failover mechanism simply changes the DNS record of the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance. As a result, the user will need to re-establish any existing connections to the DB instance. However, as the DNS is the same, the application can access DB seamlessly.

Q: How many Read Replicas can I create for a given source DB Instance?
Amazon RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL currently allow you to create up to five (5) Read Replicas for a given source DB Instance.

Q: Do Amazon RDS Read Replicas support synchronous replication?
No. Read Replicas in Amazon RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL are implemented using those engines' native asynchronous replication.

Q: Can I create a Read Replica of another Read Replica?
Amazon RDS for MySQL: You can create a second-tier Read Replica from an existing first-tier Read Replica. By creating a second-tier Read Replica, you may be able to move some of the replication load from the master database instance to a first-tier Read Replica. Please note that a second-tier Read Replica may lag further behind the master because of additional replication latency introduced as transactions are replicated from the master to the first tier replica and then to the second-tier replica.

A brief I/O freeze, typically lasting a few seconds, occurs during
both automated backups and DB snapshot operations on Single-AZ DB
instances.

During the backup window, storage I/O may be suspended while your data
is being backed up and you may experience elevated latency.

This period of I/O suspension is shorter for Multi-AZ DB deployments,
since the backup is taken from the standby, but latency can occur
during the backup process.

Changing the backup retention period to 0 turns off automatic backups
for the DB instance, and deletes all existing automated backups for
the instance.

Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service to provide a notification when an Amazon RDS event occurs. These events can be configured for source categories, such as DB instance, DB security group, DB snapshot and DB parameter group. If the user is subscribed to a Configuration Change category for a DB security group, he will be notified when the DB security group is changed.

A user is using a small MySQL RDS DB. The user is experiencing high latency due to the Multi AZ feature. Which of the below mentioned options may not help the user in this situation?

Use PIOPS
Schedule the automated back up in non-working hours
Use a large or higher size instance
Take a snapshot from standby Replica

D
An RDS DB instance which has enabled Multi AZ deployments may experience increased write and commit latency compared to a Single AZ deployment, due to synchronous data replication. The user may also face changes in latency if deployment fails over to the standby replica. For production workloads, AWS recommends the user to use provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) as they are optimized for provisioned IOPS to give a fast, and consistent performance. With Multi AZ feature, the user can not have option to take snapshot from replica.

** Why should I use Amazon VPC?
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/
- Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud
- Define your own network space and control how your network
- Leverage the greatly enhanced security options in Amazon VPC to provide more granular access for your EC2 instances
** Benefits of Using a VPC
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#concepts-vpc
- Assign static private IP addresses to your instances that persist across starts and stops
- Assign multiple IP addresses to your instances
- Define network interfaces, and attach one or more network interfaces to your instances
- Change security group membership for your instances while they're running
- Control the outbound traffic from your instances (egress filtering) in addition to controlling the inbound traffic to them (ingress filtering)
- Add an additional layer of access control to your instances in the form of network access control lists (ACL)
- Run your instances on single-tenant hardware
** [#A] Security in Your VPC: SecurityGroup and NACLs             :IMPORTANT:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html
Amazon VPC provides two features that you can use to increase security for your VPC:
- Security groups-Act as a firewall for associated Amazon EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level
- Network access control lists (ACLs)-Act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level

You can use AWS Identity and Access Management to control who in your
organization has permission to create and manage security groups and
network ACLs. For example, you can give only your network
administrators that permission, but not personnel who only need to
launch instances.

- An Internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly
  available VPC component that allows communication between instances
  in your VPC and the Internet.

An Internet gateway serves two purposes:
- Provide a target in your VPC route tables for Internet-routable traffic
- Perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IP addresses.

To use an Internet gateway, your subnet's route table must contain a
route that directs Internet-bound traffic to the Internet gateway.

require a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
compliant infrastructure in order to protect sensitive customer data.

Because AWS is accredited as a Level 1 service provider under PCI DSS,
you can run your application on PCI-compliant technology

To enable the flow of traffic, both local VPC and peer VPC need an extra route rule to routing tables

You are charged for data transfer within a VPC peering connection at
the same rate as you are charged for data transfer across Availability
Zones.

Limitation of VPC Peer
- You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs in different regions.
- You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks.
- VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships
- The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) across a VPC peering connection is 1500 bytes.

To establish a VPC peering connection, the owner of the requester VPC
(or local VPC) sends a request to the owner of the peer VPC to create
the VPC peering connection. The peer VPC can be owned by you, or
another AWS account, and cannot have a CIDR block that overlaps with
the requester VPC's CIDR block. The owner of the peer VPC has to
accept the VPC peering connection request to activate the VPC peering
connection. To enable the flow of traffic between the peer VPCs using
private IP addresses, add a route to one or more of your VPC's route
tables that points to the IP address range of the peer VPC. The owner
of the peer VPC adds a route to one of their VPC's route tables that
points to the IP address range of your VPC. You may also need to
update the security group rules that are associated with your instance
to ensure that traffic to and from the peer VPC is not restricted. For
more information about security groups, see Security Groups for Your
VPC.

Q. How do instances without EIPs access the Internet?

Instances without EIPs can access the Internet in one of two ways:
Instances without EIPs can route their traffic through a NAT instance to access the Internet. These instances use the EIP of the NAT instance to traverse the Internet. The NAT instance allows outbound communication but doesn't enable machines on the Internet to initiate a connection to the privately addressed machines using NAT.
For VPCs with a Hardware VPN connection, instances can route their Internet traffic down the Virtual Private Gateway to your existing datacenter. From there, it can access the Internet via your existing egress points and network security/monitoring devices.

After setting up a VPC for your own testing purposes you now decide to set up a subnet but are unsure how many addresses will be allocated per subnet. By default how many addresses are allocated per subnet?

4,096
64
2048
1024

A

The CIDR block for a default VPC is always 172.31.0.0/16. This provides up to 65,536 private IP addresses.
The netmask for a default subnet is always /20, which provides up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for our use.
By default, a default subnet is a public subnet, because the main route table sends the subnet's traffic that is destined for the Internet to the Internet gateway. You can make a default subnet a private subnet by removing the route from the destination 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet gateway. However, if you do this, any EC2 instance running in that subnet can't access the Internet or other AWS products, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

A user has configured a VPC with a new subnet. The user has created a security group. The user wants to configure that instances of the same subnet communicate with each other. How can the user configure this with the security group?

Configure the subnet as the source in the security group and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports
The user has to use VPC peering to configure this
Configure the security group itself as the source and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports
There is no need for a security group modification as all the instances can communicate with each other inside the same subnet

C

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. AWS provides two features that the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level. If the user is using the default security group it will have a rule which allows the instances to communicate with other. For a new security group the user has to specify the rule, add it to define the source as the security group itself, and select all the protocols and ports for that source

You'll be presented with four basic options for network architectures. After selecting an option, you can modify the size and IP address range of the VPC and its subnets. If you select an option with Hardware VPN Access, you will need to specify the IP address of the VPN hardware on your network. You can modify the VPC to add more subnets or add or remove gateways at any time after the VPC has been created.
The four options are:
VPC with a Single Public Subnet Only
VPC with Public and Private Subnets
VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access
VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN Access

** DONE [#A] Attaching another network interface to an instance is not a method to increase the network bandwidth
  CLOSED: [2015-05-06 Wed 11:57]
You need to create a management network using network interfaces for a virtual private cloud (VPC) network. Which of the following statements is incorrect pertaining to Best Practices for Configuring Network Interfaces.

When launching an instance from the CLI or API, you can specify the network interfaces to attach to the instance for both the primary (eth0) and additional network interfaces.
You can attach a network interface to an instance when it's running (hot attach), when it's stopped (warm attach), or when the instance is being launched (cold attach).
You can attach a network interface in one subnet to an instance in another subnet in the same VPC, however, both the network interface and the instance must reside in the same Availability Zone.
Attaching another network interface to an instance is a valid method to increase or double the network bandwidth to or from the dual-homed instance

D

Best Practices for Configuring Network Interfaces
You can attach a network interface to an instance when it's running (hot attach), when it's stopped (warm attach), or when the instance is being launched (cold attach).
You can detach secondary (ethN) network interfaces when the instance is running or stopped. However, you can't detach the primary (eth0) interface.
You can attach a network interface in one subnet to an instance in another subnet in the same VPC, however, both the network interface and the instance must reside in the same Availability Zone.
When launching an instance from the CLI or API, you can specify the network interfaces to attach to the instance for both the primary (eth0) and additional network interfaces.
Launching an instance with multiple network interfaces automatically configures interfaces, private IP addresses, and route tables on the operating system of the instance.
A warm or hot attach of an additional network interface may require you to manually bring up the second interface, configure the private IP address, and modify the route table accordingly. (Instances running Amazon Linux automatically recognize the warm or hot attach and configure themselves.)
Attaching another network interface to an instance is not a method to increase or double the network bandwidth to or from the dual-homed instance.

A user has created a subnet with VPC and launched an EC2 instance in that subnet with only default settings. Which of the below mentioned options is ready to use on the EC2 instance as soon as it is launched?

Internet gateway
Private IP
Elastic IP
Public IP

B
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to  a user's AWS account. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the VPC. The user can launch the AWS resources into a subnet. There are two supported platforms into which a user can launch instances: EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC. When the user launches an instance which is not a part of the non-default subnet, it will only have a private IP assigned to it. The instances part of a subnet can communicate with each other but cannot communicate over the internet or to the AWS services, such as RDS / S3.

A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/24. The user has created a public subnet with CIDR 20.0.0.0/25. The user is trying to create the private subnet with CIDR 20.0.0.128/25. Which of the below mentioned statements is true in this scenario?

It will not allow the user to create the private subnet due to a CIDR overlap
This statement is wrong as AWS does not allow CIDR 20.0.0.0/25
It will allow the user to create a private subnet with CIDR as 20.0.0.128/25
It will not allow the user to create a private subnet due to a wrong CIDR range
When the user creates a subnet in VPC, he specifies the CIDR block for the subnet. The CIDR block of a subnet can be the same as the CIDR block for the VPC (for a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset (to enable multiple subnets). If the user creates more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets must not overlap. Thus, in this case the user has created a VPC with the CIDR block 20.0.0.0/24, which supports 256 IP addresses (20.0.0.0 to 20.0.0.255). The user can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses. One subnet uses the CIDR block 20.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 20.0.0.0 - 20.0.0.127) and the other uses the CIDR block 20.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 20.0.0.128 - 20.0.0.255).

A user has configured a VPC with a new subnet. The user has created a security group. The user wants to configure that instances of the same subnet communicate with each other. How can the user configure this with the security group?

Configure the security group itself as the source and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports
There is no need for a security group modification as all the instances can communicate with each other inside the same subnet
Configure the subnet as the source in the security group and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports
The user has to use VPC peering to configure this

A

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. AWS provides two features that the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level. If the user is using the default security group it will have a rule which allows the instances to communicate with other. For a new security group the user has to specify the rule, add it to define the source as the security group itself, and select all the protocols and ports for that source.

** DONE [#B] DynamoDB supports a "conditional write" feature
  CLOSED: [2015-04-22 Wed 11:08]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html
Most write operations in DynamoDB allow conditional writes, where you
specify one or more conditions that must be met in order for the
operation to succeed.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/APISummary.html
In the "lost update" example, client 2 can add a condition to verify
item values on the server-side are same as the item copy on the
client-side. If the item on the server is updated, client 2 can choose
to get an updated copy before applying its own updates.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Conditional Updates and Concurrency Control

In a multiuser environment, it is important to ensure data updates made by one client don't overwrite updates made by another client. This "lost update" problem is a classic database concurrency issue. Suppose two clients read the same item. Both clients get a copy of that item from DynamoDB. Client 1 then sends a request to update the item. Client 2 is not aware of any update. Later, Client 2 sends its own request to update the item, overwriting the update made by Client 1. Thus, the update made by Client 1 is lost.

DynamoDB supports a "conditional write" feature that lets you specify a condition when updating an item. DynamoDB writes the item only if the specified condition is met; otherwise it returns an error. In the "lost update" example, client 2 can add a condition to verify item values on the server-side are same as the item copy on the client-side. If the item on the server is updated, client 2 can choose to get an updated copy before applying its own updates.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/APISummary.html
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
DynamoDB also supports an "atomic counter" feature where you can send a request to add or subtract from an existing attribute value without interfering with another simultaneous write request. For example, a web application might want to maintain a counter per visitor to its site. In this case, the client only wants to increment a value regardless of what the previous value was. DynamoDB write operations support incrementing or decrementing existing attribute values.

** DONE [#A] DynamoDB capacity units: Read Capacity Units and Write Capacity Units
  CLOSED: [2015-04-22 Wed 12:10]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughputIntro.html

- For example, if BatchGetItem reads a 1.5 KB item and a 6.5 KB item,
  DynamoDB will calculate the size as 12 KB (4 KB + 8 KB), not 8 KB
  (1.5 KB + 6.5 KB).

When you create or update a table, you specify how much provisioned
throughput capacity you want to reserve for reads and writes. DynamoDB
will reserve the necessary machine resources to meet your throughput
needs while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance.

- For tables with secondary indexes, DynamoDB consumes additional capacity units.
  For example, if you wanted to add a single 1 KB item to a table, and
  that item contained an indexed attribute, then you would need two
  write capacity units-one for writing to the table, and another for
  writing to the index.

- You cannot group multiple items in a single read operation, even if the items together are 4 KB or smaller.
  For example, if your items are 3 KB and you want to read 80 items
  per second from your table, then you need to provision 80 (reads per
  second) x 1 (3 KB / 4 KB = 0.75, rounded up to the next whole
  number) = 80 read capacity units for strong consistency. For
  eventual consistency, you need to provision only 40 read capacity
  units.

- You can use the Query and Scan operations in DynamoDB to retrieve
  multiple consecutive items from a table or an index in a single
  request.

  With these operations, DynamoDB uses the cumulative size of the
  processed items to calculate provisioned throughput. For example, if
  a Query operation retrieves 100 items that are 1 KB each, the read
  capacity calculation is not (100 x 4 KB) = 100 read capacity units,
  as if those items were retrieved individually using GetItem or
  BatchGetItem. Instead, the total would be only 25 read capacity
  units ((100 * 1024 bytes) = 100 KB, which is then divided by 4
  KB). For more information see Item Size Calculations.

Snapshots occur asynchronously and the status of the snapshot is pending until the snapshot is complete.

A sys admin is trying to understand EBS snapshots. Which of the below mentioned statements will not be useful to the admin to understand the concepts about a snapshot?

The snapshot is synchronous
The snapshot is incremental
It is recommended to stop the instance before taking a snapshot for consistent data
The snapshot captures the data that has been written to the hard disk when the snapshot command was executed

A

The AWS snapshot is a point in time backup of an EBS volume. When the snapshot command is executed it will capture the current state of the data that is written on the drive and take a backup. For a better and consistent snapshot of the root EBS volume, AWS recommends stopping the instance. For additional volumes it is recommended to unmount the device. The snapshots are asynchronous and incremental.

** TODO [#A] When taking EBS snapshot which is in use, I/O on the volume will not be frozen automatically?

- You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use.
  In this way, snapshot EBS may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system.

- If you can pause any file writes to the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete.

- However, if you can't pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance.

A
AWS EBS supports encryption of the volume. It also supports creating volumes from existing snapshots provided the snapshots are created from encrypted volumes. If the user is having data on an encrypted volume and is trying to share it with others, he has to copy the data from the encrypted volume to a new unencrypted volume.  Only then can the user share it as an encrypted volume data. Otherwise the snapshot cannot be shared.

It will remove the snapshot of Day-2 and the user will lose the contents of Blocks-"B" and "D"

A
Snapshot is an incremental concept and EBS takes a snapshot of only the modified blocks of volume. In this case Day-2 will have blocks of modified "B" and new "D". Since "D" is not modified on Day-3 it will not be deleted. However, as "B" was modified on Day-3 it is not being referred by any snapshot and EBS will delete that block.

- You can't share encrypted snapshots

  Encrypted snapshots cannot be shared with anyone, because your
  volume encryption keys and master key are specific to your
  account. If you need to share your encrypted snapshot data, you can
  migrate the data to an unencrypted volume and share a snapshot of
  that volume.

In Amazon Web Services, when a user is sharing an AMI with another user, the owner needs to give explicit permission to other users to create a volume from the snapshot. Otherwise the other user cannot create a volume from the snapshot.

- "Point in Time" snapshots are created from the original data source in a pointer based approach.

"Point in Time" snapshots are created from the original data source in
a pointer based approach. This method of capturing a mountable picture
of how data looked at a point in time is fast, and requires a fraction
of the space of the original source LUN.  When data is written to the
source disk after a "Point in Time" snapshot is taken, the original
block/blocks of data are written to the snapshot or the "change pool"
then the change is committed to the source disk. Here you can see that
the "Point in Time" snapshot is useless without the original LUN since
unchanged blocks are only referenced as pointers to the original
source LUN. Think of the relationship a traditional differential
backup has with a full backup; without the full back tape the
differentials are worthless.

   CLOSED: [2015-05-04 Mon 09:00]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html

Several factors can affect the performance of Amazon EBS volumes, such
as instance configuration, I/O characteristics, workload demand, and
storage configuration.

#  --8<-------------------------- separator ------------------------>8--
When a user is accessing an EBS for the first time there can be a huge reduction in the I/O. How can the user avoid this?

Use PIOPS to increase the I/O first time
Pre-warm the EBS volumes as per the requirement
There is no decrease in the I/O performance the first time and the user can use it as it is
Use a higher instance size which gives better I/O

B

There is a 5 to 50 percent reduction in IOPS when the user first accesses each block of data on a newly created or restored EBS volume. The user can avoid this performance hit by accessing each block in advance or pre-warm the Amazon EBS volumes.

Backups to Amazon Glacier be performed through the database management system.
Backups to Amazon S3 be performed through the database management system .
If you take regular snapshots no further backups are required.
Backups to AWS Storage Gateway be performed through the database management system.

B

Data stored in Amazon EBS volumes is redundantly stored in multiple physical locations as part of normal operation of those services and at no additional charge.
However, Amazon EBS replication is stored within the same availability zone, not across multiple zones; therefore, it is highly recommended that you conduct regular snapshots to Amazon S3 for long-term data durability.
For customers who have architected complex transactional databases using EBS, it is recommended that backups to Amazon S3 be performed through the database management system so that distributed transactions and logs can be checkpointed.
AWS does not perform backups of data that are maintained on virtual disks attached to running instances on Amazon EC2.

ou have just set up your first Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) but it does not seem to be configured properly. You discover that before you start using ELB, you have to configure the listeners for your load balancer. Which protocols does ELB use to support the load balancing of applications?

HTTP, HTTPS and TCP
HTTP, HTTPS , TCP, SSL and SSH
HTTP, HTTPS , TCP, and SSL
HTTP and HTTPS

C

Before you start using Elastic Load Balancing(ELB), you have to configure the listeners for your load balancer. A listener is a process that listens for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and a port number for front-end (client to load balancer) and back-end (load balancer to back-end instance) connections.
Elastic Load Balancing supports the load balancing of applications using HTTP, HTTPS (secure HTTP), TCP, and SSL (secure TCP) protocols. The HTTPS uses the SSL protocol to establish secure connections over the HTTP layer. You can also use SSL protocol to establish secure connections over the TCP layer.
The acceptable ports for both HTTPS/SSL and HTTP/TCP connections are 25, 80, 443, 465, 587, and 1024-65535.

An organization is setting up an application on AWS to have both High Availabilty (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR). The organization wants to have both Recovery point objective (RPO) and Recovery time objective (RTO) of 10 minutes. Which of the below mentioned service configurations does not help the organization achieve the said RPO and RTO?

Use an AMI copy to keep the AMI available in other regions.
Create ELB with multi- region routing to allow automated failover when required.
Use an elastic IP to assign to a running instance and use Route 53 to map the user's domain with that IP.
Take a snapshot of the data every 10 minutes and copy it to the other region.

B

AWS provides an on demand, scalable infrastructure. AWS EC2 allows the user to launch On-Demand instances and the organization should create an AMI of the running instance. Copy the AMI to another region to enable Disaster Recovery (DR) in case of region failure. The organization should also use EBS for persistent storage and take a snapshot every 10 minutes to meet Recovery time objective (RTO). They should also setup an elastic IP and use it with Route 53 to route requests to the same IP.
When one of the instances fails the organization can launch new instances and assign the same EIP to a new instance to achieve High Availabilty (HA). The ELB works only for a particular region and does not route requests across regions.

If the EC2 instances count is imbalanced across the AZ, the load
balancer begins to route traffic equally amongst all the enabled
Availability Zones *irrespective of the instance count in each zone*.

- To ensure that your back-end instances are able to handle the
  request load in each Availability Zone, it is important to keep
  approximately the same number of instances in each Availability Zone
  registered with the load balancer. For example, if you have ten
  instances in Availability Zone us-west-2a and two instances in
  us-west-2b, the traffic is equally distributed between the two
  Availability Zones. As a result, the two instances in us-west-2b
  serve the same amount of traffic as the ten instances in
  us-west-2a. Instead, you should distribute your instances so that
  you have six instances in each Availability Zone.

- If cross-zone load balancing is disabled, the load balancer node
  selects the instance from the same Availability Zone that it is in.

- If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the load balancer node
  selects the instance regardless of Availability Zone.
*** question

Multi zone routing
Across zone load balancing
Round Robin
Cross zone load balancing

D
Elastic Load Balancing provides the option to either enable or disable cross-zone load balancing for the load balancer. With cross-zone load balancing, the load balancer nodes route traffic to the back-end instances across all the Availability Zones.

*** question
An ELB has 8 instances registered with it. 4 instances are running in one AZ, while 2 each are running in two separate AZs. By default, when a user request arrives how will ELB distribute the load?

Distributing requests across all instances equally
Distributing requests across all AZs equally irrespective of the instance count in each AZ
The AZ with a higher instance will have more requests than others
The new  request will go to the higher instance count AZ while the old requests will go to AZs with a lower number of instances

B

If the EC2 instances count is imbalanced across the AZ, the load balancer begins to route traffic equally amongst all the enabled Availability Zones irrespective of the instance count in each zone. If the user wants to distribute traffic equally amongst all the instances, the user needs to enable cross zone load balancing.

*** question
Which of the below mentioned options ensures that the user requests are always attached to a single instance?

Session cookie

B

Generally an Elastic Load Balancer routes each request independently to the application instance with the smallest load. However, the user can enable the sticky session feature (also known as session affinity) which enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific application instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.

http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479
Scaling Elastic Load Balancers
Once you create an elastic load balancer, you must configure it to accept incoming traffic and route requests to your EC2 instances. These configuration parameters are stored by the controller, and the controller ensures that all of the load balancers are operating with the correct configuration. The controller will also monitor the load balancers and manage the capacity that is used to handle the client requests. It increases capacity by utilizing either larger resources (resources with higher performance characteristics) or more individual resources. The Elastic Load Balancing service will update the Domain Name System (DNS) record of the load balancer when it scales so that the new resources have their respective IP addresses registered in DNS. The DNS record that is created includes a Time-to-Live (TTL) setting of 60 seconds, with the expectation that clients will re-lookup the DNS at least every 60 seconds. By default, Elastic Load Balancing will return multiple IP addresses when clients perform a DNS resolution, with the records being randomly ordered on each DNS resolution request. As the traffic profile changes, the controller service will scale the load balancers to handle more requests, scaling equally in all Availability Zones.

Your load balancer will also perform health checks on the EC2 instances that are registered with the Elastic Load Balancing service. The health checks must reach the defined target set in the Elastic Load Balancing configuration for the number of successful checks before the instance is considered in service and healthy. For example, for any instance registered with Elastic Load Balancing, if you set the interval for health checks to 20 seconds, and you set the number of successful health checks to 10, then it will take at least 200 seconds before Elastic Load Balancing will route traffic to the instance. The health check also defines a failure threshold. For example, if you set the interval to 20 seconds, and you set the failure threshold at 4, then when an instance no longer responds to requests, at least 80 seconds will elapse before it is taken out of service. However, if an instance is terminated, traffic will no longer be sent to the terminated instance, but there can be a delay before the load balancer is aware that the instance was terminated. For this reason, it is important to de-register your instances before terminating them; instances will be removed from service in a much shorter amount of time if they are de-registered.

A

The Elastic Load Balancer connection draining feature causes the load balancer to stop sending new requests to the back-end instances when the instances are deregistering or become unhealthy, while ensuring that in-flight requests continue to be served. The user can specify a maximum time (3600 seconds) for the load balancer to keep the connections alive before reporting the instance as deregistered. If the user does not specify the maximum timeout period, by default, the load balancer will close the connections to the deregistering instance after 300 seconds.

ELB will send data every minute and will charge the user extra
ELB is not supported by CloudWatch
It is not possible to setup detailed monitoring for ELB
ELB sends data to CloudWatch every minute only and does not charge the user

D
CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data points to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points to CloudWatch every minute. Elastic Load Balancing includes 10 metrics and 2 dimensions, and sends data to CloudWatch every minute. This does not cost extra.

- Duration-Based Session Stickiness
  If there is no cookie, the load balancer chooses an instance based
  on the existing load balancing algorithm.

  The stickiness policy configuration defines a cookie expiration,
  which establishes the duration of validity for each cookie. The
  cookie is automatically updated after its duration expires.

- Application-Controlled Session Stickiness
  If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the
  session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

A user has enabled Application-Controlled Session Stickiness. The instance the user's session was bound to becomes unhealthy for 10 minutes. The unhealthy instance becomes healthy again after 10 minutes. What will ELB do in this case?

ELB will route requests to the original instance again
ELB will try to route the sticky session to another healthy application server
The unhealthy instance will never be registered back with ELB once it has been declared unhealthy
ELB will throw an error

B

If an application server fails or is removed, the Elastic Load Balancer will try to route the sticky session to another healthy application server. The load balancer will try to stick to a new healthy application server and continue routing to the currently sick application server even after the failed application server comes back. However, it is up to the new application server on how it will respond to a request which it has not seen previously.

A

Elastic Load Balancing provides a special Amazon EC2 source security group that the user can use to ensure that back-end EC2 instances receive traffic only from Elastic Load Balancing. This feature needs two security groups: the source security group and a security group that defines the ingress rules for the back-end instances. To ensure that traffic only flows between the load balancer and the back-end instances, the user can add or modify a rule to the back-end security group which can limit the ingress traffic. Thus, it can come only from the source security group provided by Elastic load Balancing.

Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name (example.com) to another 'target' DNS name (elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com).
They differ from a CNAME record in that they are not visible to resolvers.

Additionally, Route 53 offers 'Alias' records (a Route 53-specific
virtual record). Alias records are used to map resource record sets in
your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, CloudFront
distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites. Alias
records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name
(example.com) to another 'target' DNS name
(elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com). They differ from a CNAME record in that
they are not visible to resolvers. Resolvers only see the A record and
the resulting IP address of the target record.

Q. How quickly will changes I make to my DNS settings on Amazon Route 53 propagate globally?

Amazon Route 53 is designed to propagate updates you make to your DNS
records to its world-wide network of authoritative DNS servers within
60 seconds under normal conditions. A change is successfully
propagated world-wide when the API call returns an INSYNC status
listing.

Note that caching DNS resolvers are outside the control of the Amazon
Route 53 service and will cache your resource record sets according to
their time to live (TTL). The INSYNC or PENDING status of a change
refers only to the state of Route 53's authoritative DNS servers.

5 of 20.
An enterprise customer would like to host some of their corporate servers in Amazon Web Services and have chosen to create a VPC deployment as an extension of their on-premises data center. The existing on-premises data center already has multiple redundant DNS servers. These DNS servers are hosting DNS records for several internal applications, such as mail servers and business applications. The corporate security policy specifies that the DNS names for the internal applications can only be resolved within the secure internal corporate network through the on-premises DNS server and cannot be resolved over the public internet or through a Public DNS server.  The on-premises DNS servers can resolve Internet domain names through recursion.  Secure network connectivity between the VPC and the on-premises data center has been established using IPSec VPN.

The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances that are launched within this VPC will host applications that frequently connect to the corporate applications hosted in the on-premises data center. The enterprise policy mandates the use of domain names to connect to all internal applications.

Select the option that is most effective for building a scalable DNS architecture:


A.		Create a new Route 53 hosted zone for the internal domain and add all internal domain names as record sets in the Route 53 hosted-zone. Modify the default DHCP option set for the VPC to specify the domain name server value as Route 53.
B.		Create a new Route 53 hosted-zone for the internal domain name, and configure Route 53 to forward all DNS queries for internal domain names to the on-premises DNS servers. Modify the default DHCP option set for the VPC to specify the domain name server value as Route 53.
C.		Create a new DHCP option set that specifies the domain name server value as the on-premises DNS servers. Replace the default DHCP option set for the VPC with the newly created DHCP option set.
D.		Create two DHCP options sets, DHCPSetA and DHCPSetB. Configure DHCPSetA to specify the Amazon-provided DNS server as the domain name server to resolve all Internet domain names. Configure DHCPSetB to specify the on-premises DNS server as the domain name server to resolve all internal domain names. Apply both the DHCP options set to the VPC so that both Internet domain names and internal domain names can be resolved.

Useful when application is hosted in multiple AWS region

Benefits for LBR:
- Better performance than running in a single region
- Improved reliability relative to running in a single region
- Easier implementation than traditional DNS solutions
- Much lower prices than traditional DNS solutions

For example, suppose you have ELB load balancers in the US West
(Oregon) region and in the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region, and that
you've created a latency resource record set in Amazon Route 53 for
each load balancer. A user in London enters the name of your domain in
a browser, and DNS routes the request to an Amazon Route 53 name
server. Amazon Route 53 refers to its data on latency between London
and the Singapore region and between London and the Oregon region. If
latency is lower between London and the Oregon region, Amazon Route 53
responds to the user's request with the IP address of your load
balancer in the Amazon EC2 data center in Oregon. If latency is lower
between London and the Singapore region, Amazon Route 53 responds with
the IP address of your load balancer in the Amazon EC2 data center in
Singapore.

Getting Started with Gateway-Cached volumes on AWS Storage Gateway

http://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/details/
** How to use Amazon Storage Gateway
AWS Storage Gateway's software appliance is available for download as
a virtual machine (VM) image that you install on a host in your
datacenter. Once you've installed your gateway and associated it with
your AWS account through our activation process, you can use the AWS
Management Console to create either gateway-cached or gateway-stored
volumes that can be mounted as iSCSI devices by your on-premises
applications.

Procedure:
- Provision a Host
Provision a host in your datacenter to deploy the gateway virtual machine (VM).

- Download and Deploy the VM
Download the VM and deploy it to your local host.

- Provision Local Disk Storage
Allocate disks to your deployed VM for low-latency on-premises access to your application data and to temporarily buffer writes before your data is uploaded to AWS.

- Activate Your Gateway
Activate your gateway and select an AWS Region to store your uploaded data.
** Gateway-cached volumes
Gateway-cached volumes allow you to utilize Amazon S3 for your primary
data, while retaining some portion of it locally in a cache for
frequently accessed data.

You can create storage volumes up to 32 TBs in size

Data written to these volumes is stored in Amazon S3, with only a
cache of recently written and recently read data stored locally on
your on-premises storage hardware.
** Gateway-stored volumes store your primary data locally, while asynchronously backing up that data to AWS.
You can create storage volumes up to 1 TB in size and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on- premises application servers

The default termination policy:

1. Auto Scaling determines whether there are instances in multiple
   Availability Zones. If so, it selects the Availability Zone with
   the most instances. If there is more than one Availability Zone
   with this number of instances, Auto Scaling selects the
   Availability Zone with the instances that use the oldest launch
   configuration.

2. Auto Scaling determines which instances in the selected
   Availability Zone use the oldest launch configuration. If there is
   one such instance, it terminates it.

3. If there are multiple instances that use the oldest launch
   configuration, Auto Scaling determines which instances are closest
   to the next billing hour. (This helps you maximize the use of your
   EC2 instances while minimizing the number of hours you are billed
   for Amazon EC2 usage.) If there is one such instance, Auto Scaling
   terminates it.

4. If there is more than one instance closest to the next billing
   hour, Auto Scaling selects one of these instances at random.

Even though the user has configured the termination policy, before AutoScaling selects an instance to terminate, it first identifies the Availability Zone that has more instances than the other Availability Zones used by the group. If both the zones have the same instance count it will select the zone randomly. Within the selected Availability Zone, it identifies the instance that matches the specified termination policy. In this case it will identify the AZ randomly and then first delete the oldest instance from that zone which matches the termination policy.

- If the value is less than -1, Auto Scaling rounds it to the higher
  value. For example, a return value of -6.67 is rounded to -6.

A user has configured AutoScaling with policy based scaling. The user has 53 instances running right now. The policy states that the count should decrease  by 10%. How many instances will be running after the scaling activity is complete?

48
47
52
50

A
AutoScaling rounds off the values returned by the PercentChangeInCapacity to the higher number if value is negative. If the current count is 53 and  the policy gets executed, the total number of instances to be decreased will be calculated as 5.3 (10% of 53). AWS will round it off to 5 and terminate 5 more instances.

** DONE Delete Resource of Auto Scaling By CLI and web console is slightly different
  CLOSED: [2015-05-03 Sun 20:06]
A user is trying to delete an Auto Scaling group from CLI. Which of the below mentioned steps are to be performed by the user?

There is no need to change the capacity. Run the as-delete-group command and it will reset all values to 0
Terminate the instances with the ec2-terminate-instance command
Terminate the Auto Scaling instances with the as-terminate-instance command
Set the minimum size and desired capacity to 0

D

If the user wants to delete the Auto Scaling group, the user should manually set the values of the minimum and desired capacity to 0. Otherwise Auto Scaling will not allow for the deletion of the group from CLI. While trying from the AWS console, the user need not set the values to 0 as the Auto Scaling console will automatically do so.

** DONE [#A] CloudWatch: Auto Scaling includes 7 metrics and 1 dimension
  CLOSED: [2015-05-03 Sun 07:53]
A user has configured an Auto Scaling group with ELB. The user has enabled detailed CloudWatch monitoring on Auto Scaling. Which of the below mentioned statements will help the user understand the functionality better?

It is not possible to setup detailed monitoring for Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling sends data every minute only and does not charge the user
Detailed monitoring will send data every minute without additional charges
In this case, Auto Scaling will send data every minute and will charge the user extra

D
CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data points to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring  a service sends data points to CloudWatch every minute. Auto Scaling includes 7 metrics and 1 dimension, and sends data to CloudWatch every 5 minutes by default. The user can enable detailed monitoring for Auto Scaling, which sends data to CloudWatch every minute. However, this will have some extra-costs.

** DONE Scheduled auto scale actions
  CLOSED: [2015-05-03 Sun 08:21]
A user has created a web application with Auto Scaling. The user is regularly monitoring the application and he observed that the traffic is highest on Thursday and Friday between 8 AM to 6 PM. What is the best solution to handle scaling in this case?

Schedule a policy which may scale up every day at 8 AM and scales down by 6 PM
Configure a batch process to add a instance by 8 AM and remove it by Friday 6 PM
Schedule  Auto Scaling to scale up by 8 AM Thursday and scale down after 6 PM on Friday
Add a new instance manually by 8 AM Thursday and terminate the same by 6 PM Friday

C

Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to predictable load changes. In this case the load increases by Thursday and decreases by Friday. Thus, the user can setup the scaling activity based on the predictable traffic patterns of the web application using Auto Scaling scale by Schedule.

It is not possible to get a count of all the three metrics together. The user has to find the individual number of running, terminating and pending instances and sum it
GroupTotalInstances

D

CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. For Auto Scaling, CloudWatch provides various metrics to get the group information, such as the Number of Pending, Running or Terminating instances at any moment. If the user wants to get the total number of Running, Pending and Terminating instances at any moment, he can use the GroupTotalInstances metric.

** DONE AutoScaling healthcheck question
  CLOSED: [2015-05-04 Mon 08:17]
After moving an E-Commerce website for a client from a dedicated server to AWS you have also set up auto scaling to perform health checks on the instances in your group and replace instances that fail these checks. Your client has come to you with his own health check system that he wants you to use as it has proved to be very useful prior to his site running on AWS. What do you think would be an appropriate response to this given all that you know about auto scaling?

It is not possible to implement your own health check system. You need to use AWSs health check system.
It is possible to implement your own health check system and then send the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling.
It is possible to implement your own health check system and then send the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling but only in the US East (N. Virginia) region.
It is possible to implement your own health check system but we can't send the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling.

B

Auto Scaling periodically performs health checks on the instances in your group and replaces instances that fail these checks. By default, these health checks use the results of EC2 instance status checks to determine the health of an instance. If you use a load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, you can optionally choose to include the results of Elastic Load Balancing health checks.
Auto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2 action DescribeInstanceStatus returns any other state other than running, the system status shows impaired, or the calls to Elastic Load Balancing action DescribeInstanceHealth returns OutOfService in the instance state field.
After an instance is marked unhealthy because of an Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing health check, it is scheduled for replacement.
You can customize the health check conducted by your Auto Scaling group by specifying additional checks or by having your own health check system and then sending the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling.

Create from existing instances: ignores any additional block devices that were added to the instance after launch
*** Question
A user has launched an instance with an EBS backed root device and then attached two additional EBS volumes to it. The user is trying to create the AutoScaling Launch configuration using this instance as a reference.

How many additional block devices will the future instance have by default?

3
0
2
1

B
When a user is creating a new launch configuration from the existing instance, AS will take all the parameters except the instance ID and config name from the existing instance. The launch config though, will not take the new block device mapping into consideration and instead use the one which was the default one with AMI.  In this case there was no additional block device with EBS. Thus, the future EBS will have 0 additional EBS volumes

** DONE [#B] Feature: load-based vs time-based
  CLOSED: [2015-05-06 Wed 12:50]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-autoscaling.html

- Time-based: instances that run only at certain times or on certain days.
- Unlike 24/7 instances, which you must start and stop manually, you do not start or stop time-based or load-based instances yourself.

Automatic scaling is based on two instance types, which adjust a layer's online instances based on different criteria:
- Load-based instances allow your stack to handle variable loads by
  starting additional instances when traffic is high and stopping
  instances when traffic is low, based on any of several load
  metrics. For example, you can have AWS OpsWorks start instances when
  the average CPU utilization exceeds 80% and stop instances when the
  average CPU load falls below 60%.
- Time-based instances allow your stack to handle loads that follow a
  predictable pattern by including instances that run only at certain
  times or on certain days. For example, you could start some
  instances after 6PM to perform nightly backup tasks or stop some
  instances on weekends when traffic is lower.
*** A common practice is to use all three instance types together, as follows.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-autoscaling.html
A common practice is to use all three instance types together, as follows.

- A set 24/7 instances to handle the base load. You typically just start these instances and let them run continuously.
- A set of time-based instances, which AWS OpsWorks starts and stops to handle predictable traffic variations. For example, if your traffic is highest during working hours, you would configure the time-based instances to start in the morning and shut down in the evening.
- A set of load-based instances, which AWS OpsWorks starts and stops to handle unpredictable traffic variations. AWS OpsWorks starts them when the load approaches the capacity of the stacks' 24/7 and time-based instances, and stops them when the traffic returns to normal..
*** How Load-based Scaling Differs from Auto Healing
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-autoscaling.html
Automatic load-based scaling uses load metrics that are averaged across all running instances. If the metrics remain between the specified thresholds, AWS OpsWorks does not start or stop any instances. With auto healing, on the other hand, AWS OpsWorks automatically starts a new instance with the same configuration when an instance stops responding. The instance may not be able to respond due to a network issue or some problem with the instance.

For example, suppose that your CPU upscaling threshold is 80%, and then one instance stops responding.

If auto healing is disabled, and the remaining running instances are able to keep average CPU utilization below 80%, AWS OpsWorks does not start a new instance. It starts a replacement instance only if the average CPU utilization across the remaining instances exceeds 80%.

If auto healing is enabled, AWS OpsWorks starts a replacement instance irrespective of the load thresholds.

** Amazon Kinesis: Real-time processing of streaming Big Data
An entrepreneur comes to you with a new idea for the next big social media application that, according to him, will be bigger than Twitter and Facebook. If he is serious he will obviously need something that can handle rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation in real time. Which Amazon service will obviously be the main focus on which all your infrastructure will be built around?

Amazon AppStream
Amazon ElastiCache
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Amazon Kinesis

D

You can use Amazon Kinesis for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of data used includes IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real time, the processing is typically lightweight.
The following are typical scenarios for using Amazon Kinesis:
Accelerated log and data feed intake and processing
You can have producers push data directly into a stream. For example, push system and application logs and they'll be available for processing in seconds. This prevents the log data from being lost if the front end or application server fails. Amazon Kinesis provides accelerated data feed intake because you don't batch the data on the servers before you submit it for intake.
Real-time metrics and reporting
You can use data collected into Amazon Kinesis for simple data analysis and reporting in real time. For example, your data-processing application can work on metrics and reporting for system and application logs as the data is streaming in, rather than wait to receive batches of data.
Real-time data analytics
This combines the power of parallel processing with the value of real-time data. For example, process website clickstreams in real time, and then analyze site usability engagement using multiple different Amazon Kinesis applications running in parallel.
Complex stream processing
You can create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of Amazon Kinesis applications and data streams. This typically involves putting data from multiple Amazon Kinesis applications into another stream for downstream processing by a different Amazon Kinesis application.

** DONE Serving Private Content through CloudFront
   CLOSED: [2015-04-08 Wed 18:22]
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html

Many companies that distribute content via the Internet want to
restrict access to documents, business data, media streams, or content
that is intended for selected users, for example, users who have paid
a fee.

To securely serve this private content using CloudFront, you can do the following:
- Require that your users access your private content by using special
  CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.

- Require that your users access your Amazon S3 content using
  CloudFront URLs, not Amazon S3 URLs. Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't
  required, but we recommend it to prevent users from bypassing the
  restrictions that you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies.

When you create signed URLs or signed cookies to control access to your objects, you can specify the following restrictions:
- An ending date and time, after which the URL is no longer valid.
- (Optional) The date and time that the URL becomes valid.
- (Optional) The IP address or range of addresses of the computers that can be used to access your content.

- You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your application.
- Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn't support cookies.

Use signed cookies in the following cases:
- You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers' area of a website.

CloudFront is an AWS web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, and image files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

If an object (your content) in an edge location isn't frequently requested, CloudFront might evict the object-remove the object before its expiration date-to make room for objects that are more popular.

By default, each object automatically expires after ___ hours.

B
CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user request to the edge location that can best serve your content. You also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your objects are now held in multiple edge locations around the world.
By default, each object automatically expires after 24 hours.
To specify a different expiration time, configure your origin to add a value for either the Cache-Control max-age directive or the Expires header field to each object.

** TODO [#A] By default, CloudWatch can't see what the hypervisor can't see.
http://blog.celingest.com/en/2014/02/04/monitoring-ec2-memory-disk-usage-cloudwatch-custom-metrics/
CloudWatch relies on the information provided by this hypervisor,
which can only see the most hardware-sided part of the instance's
status, including CPU usage (but not load), total memory size (but not
memory usage), number of I/O operations on the hard disks (but not
it's partition layout and space usage) and network traffic (but not
the processes generating it).

While this can be seen as a shortcoming on the hypervisor's part, it's
actually very convenient in terms of security and performance,
otherwise the hypervisor would be an all-seeing eye, with more powers
than the root user itself.

Q: What is a Custom Metric?

You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor data produced by your own applications, scripts, and services. A custom metric is any metric you provide to Amazon CloudWatch. For example, you can use custom metrics as a way to monitor the time to load a web page, request error rates, number of processes or threads on your instance, or amount of work performed by your application. You can get started with custom metrics by using the PutMetricData API, our sample monitoring scripts for Windows and Linux, as well as a number of applications and tools offered by AWS partners.

Q:  What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?
Amazon CloudWatch Logs lets you monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application and custom log files.
With CloudWatch Logs, you can monitor your logs, in near real time, for specific phrases, values or patterns. For example, you could set an alarm on the number of errors that occur in your system logs or view graphs of latency of web requests from your application logs. You can then view the original log data to see the source of the problem. Log data can be stored and accessed for up to ten years in highly durable, low-cost storage so you don't have to worry about filling up hard drives.

Q: What kinds of things can I do with CloudWatch Logs?
CloudWatch Logs is capable of monitoring and storing your logs to help you better understand and operate your systems and applications. You can use CloudWatch Logs in a number of ways. When you use CloudWatch logs, your existing log data is used for monitoring, so no code changes are required. Real time Application and System MonitoringYou can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required.Long Term Log RetentionYou can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data for up to ten years in highly durable and cost effective storage without worrying about hard drives running out of space. The CloudWatch Logs Agent makes it easy to quickly move both rotated and non rotated log files off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log event data when you need it.

10 of 20.
As an application has increased in popularity, reports of performance issues have grown. The current configuration initiates scaling actions based on Avg CPU utilization; however during reports of slowness, CloudWatch graphs have shown that Avg CPU remains steady at 40 percent. This is well below the alarm threshold of 60 percent. Your developers have discovered that, due to the unique design of the application, performance degradation occurs on an instance when it is processing more than 200 threads.

What is the best way to ensure that your application scales to match demand?

A. Launch two to six additional instances outside of the AutoScaling group to handle the additional load.
B. Populate a custom CloudWatch metric for concurrent sessions and initiate scaling actions based on that metric instead of on CPU use.
C. Empirically determine the expected CPU use for 200 concurrent sessions and adjust the CloudWatch alarm threshold to be that CPU use.
D. Add a script to each instance to detect the number of concurrent sessions. If the number of sessions remains over 200 for five minutes, have the instance increase the desired capacity of the AutoScaling group by one.

A user has setup a web application on EC2. The user is generating a log of the application performance at every second. There are multiple entries for each second. If the user wants to send that data to CloudWatch every minute, what should he do?

It is not possible to send the custom metric to CloudWatch every minute
The user should send only the data of the 60th second  as CloudWatch will map the receive data timezone with the sent data timezone
Give CloudWatch the Min, Max, Sum, and SampleCount of a number of every minute

Amazon CloudWatch aggregates statistics according to the period length that the user has specified while getting data from CloudWatch. The user can publish as many data points as he wants with the same or similar time stamps. CloudWatch aggregates them by the period length when the user calls get statistics about those data points. CloudWatch records the average (sum of all items divided by the number of items) of the values received for every 1-minute period, as well as the number of samples, maximum value, and minimum value for the same time period. CloudWatch will aggregate all the data which have time stamps within a one-minute period.

- You can use SQS to transmit any volume of data, at any level of throughput
- Only five APIs: CreateQueue, SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, ChangeMessageVisibility, and DeleteMessage.

- The message payload can contain up to 256KB of text in any format.
  Each 64KB 'chunk' of payload is billed as 1 request. For example, a
  single API call with a 256KB payload will be billed as four
  requests.

- Messages can be retained in queues for up to 14 days.
- When a message is received, it becomes "locked" while being processed.
** DONE [#A] SQS does not guarantee first in, first out delivery of messages.
   CLOSED: [2015-05-07 Thu 16:48]
You are building an online store on AWS that uses SQS to process your customer orders. Your backend system needs those messages in the same sequence the customer orders have been put in. How can you achieve that?

You can do this with SQS but you also need to use SWF
It is not possible to do this with SQS
You can use sequencing information on each message
Messages will arrive in the same order by default

C

Amazon SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting tradeoffs is that SQS does not guarantee first in, first out delivery of messages. For many distributed applications, each message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are delivered, the order is not important. If your system requires that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information in each message, so that you can reorder the messages when the queue returns them.

** [#A] Feature: Amazon SQS Delay Queues
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html
- Delay queues are similar to visibility timeouts in that both features make messages unavailable to consumers for a specific period of time.

The difference between delay queues and visibility timeouts:
- For delay queues, a message is hidden when it is first added to the queue
- For visibility timeouts, a message is hidden only after a message is retrieved from the queue.

To use AWS Import/Export you simply:

Prepare a portable storage device (see the Product Details page for supported devices).
Submit a Create Job request to AWS that includes your Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon EBS or Amazon Glacier region, AWS Access Key ID, and return shipping address. You'll receive back a unique identifier for the job, a digital signature for authenticating your device, and an AWS address to which to ship your storage device.
Securely identify and authenticate your device. For Amazon S3, place the signature file on the root directory of your device. For Amazon EBS or Amazon Glacier, tape the signature barcode to the exterior of the device.
Ship your device along with its interface connectors, and power supply to AWS.

When your package arrives, it will be processed and securely transferred to an AWS data center, where your device will be attached to an AWS Import/Export station. After the data load completes, the device will be returned to you.

- The Amazon Glacier vault inventory is only updated once a day.

- Most Amazon Glacier jobs take about four hours to complete.
- Unlike traditional systems which can require laborious data
  verification and manual repair, Glacier performs regular, systematic
  data integrity checks and is built to be automatically self-healing.

- Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically,
  every 24 hours. If there have been no archive additions or deletions
  to the vault since the last inventory, the inventory date is not
  updated. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon
  Glacier returns the last inventory it generated, which is a
  point-in-time snapshot and not real-time data.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-vaults.html

Constraints of Glacier:
- Data can't be restored immediately but need several hours (4-5) before the files are available after issuing the restore request
- Costs depends in the amount of data stored but also restored.

Having set up an enormous amount of storage for a customer in Amazon Glacier you are concerned that there is some sort of limitation. You have organised all the data in vaults as is the standard for Amazon Glacier. How many vaults can you create?

1,000 vaults per account total
1,000 vaults per account per region
100 vaults per account per region
10,000 vaults per account per region

C

You use vaults to organize the data you store in Amazon Glacier. Each archive is stored in a vault of your choice. You may control access to your data by setting vault-level access policies using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. You can also attach notification policies to your vaults. These enable you or your application to be notified when data that you have requested for retrieval is ready for download.
You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account per region.

Q: When would I use Amazon Redshift vs. Amazon RDS?

Both Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS enable you to run traditional
relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server in the cloud
while offloading database administration. Customers use Amazon RDS
databases both for online-transaction processing (OLTP) and for
reporting and analysis. Amazon Redshift harnesses the scale and
resources of multiple nodes and uses a variety of optimizations to
provide order of magnitude improvements over traditional databases for
analytic and reporting workloads against very large data sets. Amazon
Redshift provides an excellent scale-out option as your data and query
complexity grows or if you want to prevent your reporting and analytic
processing from interfering with the performance of your OLTP
workload.

You have just been given a scope for a new client who has an enormous amount of data(petabytes) that he constantly needs analysed. Currently he is paying a huge amount of money for a data warehousing company to do this for him and is wondering if AWS can provide a cheaper solution. Do you think AWS has a solution for this?

Yes.Amazon Redshift
Yes.Amazon RDS
Yes.Your choice of relational AMIs on Amazon EC2 and EBS
Yes.Amazon DynamoDB

A
Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools. You can start small for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments or upfront costs and scale to a petabyte or more for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth of most other data warehousing solutions.
Amazon Redshift delivers fast query performance by using columnar storage technology to improve I/O efficiency and parallelizing queries across multiple nodes. Redshift uses standard PostgreSQL JDBC and ODBC drivers, allowing you to use a wide range of familiar SQL clients. Data load speed scales linearly with cluster size, with integrations to Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Amazon Kinesis or any SSH-enabled host.

VM Import/Export enables you to easily import virtual machine images
from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances and export them
back to your on-premises environment.

To import your images, use the Amazon EC2 API tools, or if you use the
VMware vSphere virtualization platform, the Amazon EC2 VM Import
Connector to target a virtual machine (VM) image in your existing
environment. You then specify which Availability Zone and instance
type you want to run in Amazon EC2, and VM Import/Export will
automatically transfer the image file and create your instance. Once
you have imported your VMs, you can take advantage of Amazon's
elasticity, scalability and monitoring via offerings like Auto
Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing and CloudWatch to support your
imported images. Your instance will be up and running in Amazon EC2 in
as little time as it takes to upload your image.

You can export previously imported EC2 instances using the Amazon EC2
API tools. You simply specify the target instance, virtual machine
file format and a destination Amazon S3 bucket, and VM Import/Export
will automatically export the instance to the Amazon S3 bucket. You
can then download and launch the exported VM within your on- premises
virtualization infrastructure.

Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) Amazon SWF helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps. You can think of SWF as a fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator in the cloud. If your application's steps take more than 500 milliseconds to complete, you need to track the state of processing. If you need to recover, or retry if a task fails, Amazon SWF can help you.

Amazon SWF promotes a separation between the control flow of your background job's stepwise logic and the actual units of work that contain your unique business logic. This allows you to separately manage, maintain, and scale the state machinery of your application from the core business logic that differentiates it. As your business requirements change, you can easily change application logic without having to worry about the underlying state machinery, task dispatch, and flow control.

Amazon SWF runs within Amazon's high-availability data centers, so the state tracking and task processing engine is available whenever applications need them. Amazon SWF redundantly stores the tasks, reliably dispatches them to application components, tracks their progress, and keeps their latest state.

Amazon SWF replaces the complexity of custom-coded workflow solutions and process automation software with a fully managed cloud workflow web service. This eliminates the need for developers to manage the infrastructure plumbing of process automation and allows them to focus their energy on the unique functionality of their application.

Amazon SWF seamlessly scales with your application's usage. No manual administration of the workflow service is required when you add more cloud workflows to your application or increase the complexity of your workflows.

Amazon SWF lets you write your application components and coordination logic in any programming language and run them in the cloud or on-premises.
* Amazon AppStream: Low Latency Application Streaming              :noexport:
With AppStream, your applications are no longer constrained by the hardware in your customers' hands.

Amazon AppStream includes a SDK that currently supports streaming
applications from Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 to devices running
FireOS, Android, Chrome, iOS, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
** question
You are setting a media server for a client and one of the services that you decide to use is Amazon AppStream. The client asks you what variables are used to measure the streaming quality for the end user. Which of the following is a wrong answer to that question?

The synchronization between audio and video (A/V sync).
The round-trip latency between user inputs and rendered outputs
Number of Frames per Second(FPS)
The video fidelity

C
Amazon AppStream is a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud. It deploys and renders your application on AWS infrastructure and streams the output to mass-market devices, such as personal computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Because your application is running in the cloud, it can scale to handle vast computational and storage needs, regardless of the devices your customers are using.
There are four main variables to consider when measuring the streaming quality for your end user:
The video fidelity
The audio fidelity
The round-trip latency between user inputs and rendered outputs
The synchronization between audio and video (A/V sync). Each of these quality variables are affected by conditions of the streaming ecosystem.
http://aws.amazon.com/appstream/faqs/
** Amazon AppStream question
You have recently set up an application server for a client using the Amazon AppStream web service. After some firewall changes over night your client complains that when he connects to his streaming application, he  gets the error, "Timed out connecting." What is the most likely reason for this problem?

Your firewall must allow traffic through TCP port 80 for Amazon AppStream to work.
The app must be the problem as Amazon AppStream does not use a firewall.
Your firewall must allow traffic through TCP port 8080 for Amazon AppStream to work.
Your firewall must allow traffic through TCP port 21 for Amazon AppStream to work.

A
The Amazon AppStream web service deploys your application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure and streams input and output between your application and devices such as personal computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
Your firewall must allow traffic through TCP port 80 for Amazon AppStream to work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abTy-Yyo6lI
Introduction to Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito is designed for mobile developers who want to
authenticate users with popular public identity providers or support
unauthenticated guest users and use the AWS Cloud to save and sync
user data for their mobile apps.

Manage user profile for mobile apps

synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices

create unique identifiers for your users

- Amazon Cognito does not receive or store user credentials
- It only store the token received from the Identity Provider is stored by Amazon Cognito.

| a silent push notification | a push message received by your app on a user's device that won't be seen by user. |
| a sync operation           |                                                                                    |
** Q: Is data saved directly to the Amazon Cognito sync store?
http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/faqs/
No. The optional AWS Mobile SDK saves your data to an SQLite database
on the local device, this way the data is always accessible to your
app. The data is pushed to the Amazon Cognito sync store by calling
the synchronize() method and, if push synchronization is enabled, all
other devices linked to an identity are notified of the data change in
the sync store via Amazon SNS.
** Q: How do I use push synchronization?
http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/faqs/
Q: How do I use push synchronization?

To enable push synchronization you need to declare a platform
application using the Amazon SNS page in the AWS Management
Console. Then, from the identity pool page in the Amazon Cognito page
of the AWS Management Console, you can link the SNS platform
application to your Cognito identity pool. Amazon Cognito
automatically utilizes the SNS platform application to notify devices
of changes.

Also just noticed, two things about AWS CodeCommit

1. It doesn't support the concept of git deploy key
2. Run git clone in one Linode VM, it's super slow. Previously the git repo is in Bitbucket. It's much faster.

Half of our infra is serverless. Makes sense when your needs are more event driven and short. We use them heavily in step functions


Puneeth [9 minutes ago]
I think yesterday, they released a new feature in step functions which links directly to logs and lambda functions from an execution


Denny Zhang [6 minutes ago]
Nice. I noticed step functions. Haven't got the time to check it though.

@Puneeth what's your understanding of AWS step functions?


Puneeth [1 minute ago]
We use it extensively in production now. It made our serverless architecture lot simpler. No more tons of sqs to orchestrate lambda. One missing feature in step functions is the missing versioning . So I basically hacked terraform to create a new state machine when the definition changes.


Puneeth [< 1 minute ago]
Our use case. When we queue a flight ticket for ticketing. There is an actual person somewhere who dequeues and issues a flight ticket. It might take an hour or two or sometimes 6 hours. That's where step functions step in.
